come join us next tuesday february 21 st for discussion on chapter 3 we will talk about personal will self control and the ability to stay true to ourselves as we travel through this life the gathering is fun free and another opportunity to meet new people i decided to get creative with the leftovers of the rainbow cake instead of doing the mini cupcake rainbow i had planned it worked out so well and i don t think it turned out too bad in her hair they are both chunky knits and were a complete bargain the green was 1 and the multi colour knit was 2 the charity shops have now started putting out their winter stocks so using these knits as inspiration why don t you go and hunt down a stylish cosy bargain for much less than the high street or designer versions every day every single day i do this with my nemesis i75 and every single day i remember what a dumbass i am for thinking i can beat the odds that i won t be thinking unkind thoughts about whomever caused the accident that has resulted in the bumper to bumper clusterfuck that is the worst commute in the nation i lament the fact that they don t have formal drivers education here that the public transportation system is pretty much nonexistent and of course i berate myself for once again for forgetting that the back roads aren t just more scenic they re more efficient too and for hot coffee to make those chilly mornings even more enjoyable he may not always take part in our insane escapades or hang around the newsroom as much as we do but i love ryan too death i know he s all arts and entertainment now but

the below article by aadil palkhivala an ayurvedic practitioner who is widely regarded as one of the world s top yoga teachers things that particularly resonated with me are his simple yet powerful statements like there is no perfect diet and no ideal food i encourage you to monitor your food intake to determine what works for you and what doesn t diet has to be adjusted individually good common

session that presented the reality of writing as a profession not as a quixotic pursuit or a weekend hobby or gap year boondoggle admittedly i wanted this for myself as much as anything because i

manage to make it work i m always grateful for time with writers who will share honestly how they get by a recent conversation revealed a writer s need to sell multiple stories about one destination

reading and videos available can cause a lot of unneccessary fear yes you will probably have some aprehension regardless as this is a complete unknown but it doesn t have to be the scary experience our society often makes it out to be no matter what kind of birth you want you and your baby can benefit from this method those who casually say oh we re going to try to do it naturally but we ll see how it goes are usually not mentally prepared for the challenge for women who would really like to have a natural birth you have to go into it with a completely dedicated mindset and an understanding of what is going on as well as a supportive birth team that knows your wishes i can t say enough how important it was that we had dawn the doula for support and our midwife and the hospital staff on

israelis can we can t say the israelis don t kill civilians at most we can say that the extent of idf operations makes it impossible to ascertain if the civilians that they kill are intended murders or not the recent case of an old man killed in his sleep by idf forces provides an excellent example of a totally unnecessary and highly suspicious death in which the soldier who pulled the trigger is

you may just find that writing a synopsis can in fact be a key to the difference between a good story and a great story don t complicate things for yourself by over analyzing the synopsis you already have enough to do with writing and finishing the story as well as submitting it for acceptance or rejection in other ways though i still work in the same way there has to be some kind of itch something that haunts me as a writer something that these techniques of writing help me connect with inevitably i suppose some of these itches and hauntings change over time while others remain

get heavy airplay during the roughly 8 hours i spend in my car during the week notably the palliative namasté but paul s boutique is an album i hadn t listened to in years i m glad i got to take a trip down memory lane and revisit this timeless classic isn t this just another boring article illustrating the left s enduring fetish about nazis the nazi party and its acolytes were utterly destroyed over 65 years ago and its leading lights were killed or imprisoned either way nazism was totally discredited as a creed while the architects of the left s monstrous and in many ways greater crimes suffered no such fate yet in the best traditions of joseph mccarthy the uk left would have you believe that there are closet nazis everywhere in under and on the bed it s utter self serving b s which enables them to shift attention from the crimes committed by the left creating an emotional tie between the product or service your company sells and your client or consumer seems to be a mutually beneficial practice for corporations and charitable entities will this marketing trend towards sustainability and cause marketing continue if companies truly commit to incorporating sustainability and or cause marketing in their marketing strategies and these efforts result in client or customer allegiance and brand preference my opinion is that it s likely we ll see these marketing trends become standard practices these thoughts are never over they aren t it is a thought that is continuous unfortunately and all we can ever ask for is a change of weather the dreams we

office everything was quiet it as 10 a m so students were in their 10 a m classes it was bright and sunny the sun had finally shown up after weeks of torturous cold i was walking on the side walk telling myself what beautiful day it was i saw a silver pontiac approaching then something completely out of the blue happened the driver of the car took his hands off the wheel stretched out both his hands towards me sprung out his two middle fingers and angrily shouted aloud you it was loud enough that i could hear it from outside even with the car windows pulled up john mchugo chair of lib dem

she spent about 30 minutes bouncing the balloon up and down giggling hysterically the entire time there is nothing like a baby s laugh is there in another sense however farred s remarks reveal a mind preconditioned to see racism everywhere even where it clearly doesn t exist this is after all a professor who produced a 95 page essay claiming that something that occurs every day in the nba a coach complaining about fouls called on his best player actually showed how the nba is once again fraught with the ghostly presence of race now refracted through the asian body p 15 i took these photos yesterday of miss pearl and some sunflowers they don t even have a pony in this race nor is the conflict between the interests of workers and the state restricted to just the capitalist state in the

t like people we can only measure to discover how much and where 1 pm saturday last night i was to perform for a room full of grumpy old jews in exeter south devon i expected to face sour smug faces filled with resentment and bitterness of a people who weren t living where they thought they belonged in new york or at the very least north london and with no respect for me for having been crazy to leave new york and not successful enough for them to have heard of me we ve spent the last few weeks prepping the garden for planting including mulching the rows with wood chips we lined them with empty feed bags to keep the weeds down and piled the wood chips on top it s a little thing but it makes the garden feel so much nicer we re going to build a long narrow chicken run along the back fence as well nothing grows that close to the alders anyway and i m hoping the birds will keep the forest from encroaching on our little veggie plot there are intentional moments of song those moments of thanks and joy for the privilege to live this life god has given me but other times i m caught off guard like a kid humming in class too many times finally called out by the teacher glued to my seat and my wine we will know something funny about this guy is that he told us few time ago he was gonna marry daisy told me that for sure there was an engagement kid instead of an engagement ring besides all this my answer was maybe they are truly in love but this time daisy was right of white marble pray for the team returning they are in the middle of a thirty hour odyssey as they come home ask god to help them adjust to our time zone adapt to what has happened here and to try to share what god has done in them with passion grace and tact a hint of ripple in the interim the gang has been playing a lot of sadly unpainted dystopian wars as usual with a new game we continue to figure out new rules we re forgetting but we re getting much closer to rules transparency with every game i m learning the shortcomings and strengths of the brit fleet likewise i m learning to love the echelon formation more lovingly dubbed the broadside conga line those hull ripping submersibles need to be released like yesterday i m seeing a fleet based on dreadnaughts frigates bombers and vanguard subs delicious breakfast slim fast shake but then we move here and suddenly it s like i can t wait to get away from him i want to work extra hours and not because of the pay i want to spend all the time i can downstairs at my sisters so i don t have to talk to him or worse hear him talk he doesn t ever want to talk about anything important to us as a couple only what he heard on the radio that day or saw on the news or read on line he s worked a whole 5 days since november as a temp at the book bindery that my brother in law works at he s not looked for a real job since right before christmas his car needs a new alternator his phone bill is out of control he wants a new this and a new that and he complains all the time about the house which was built in the 40 s and taken very good care of ever is too cold too drafty too whatever it snows too much in wisconsin it s too cold for him to go jogging he wants his own garage he wants his own laundry room so that i don t have to go all the way downstairs to use my sister s he hates my brother in law don t worry it s mutual and doesn t want to be down there when he s there which makes it pretty hard for him to be down there because my bil hates for anyone to be over when he s not home i dunno he just does but that s okay since i go down there to get away from him anyways anyway here is a scrapbooking page i have made for sarah hurley s tags and tickets challenge this fortnight i used her halloween papers as my frames for my photos and her journalling tag to write on plus a hope ticket from the steampunk cd on a base of bling 12x12 cardstock on saturday we went to our favorite hotel in the museum district hotel zaza we got hour long massages at the zaspa and then spent the rest of the day longing by the pool sipping mimosas and eating a delicious lunch gin and tonic it must have fallen out when i hit that bump so did you miss me last wednesday i was on my jolly holidays we spent a fabulous week in london doing the tourist thing we saw all the sights buckingham palace westminster abbey big ben downing street tower bridge etc we visited kew gardens the science museum the royal observatory at greenwich and the british museum of course we also had time for some serious shopping too harrods fortnum masons covent garden and hamleys to name a few i even managed a trip to blade rubber stamps a great rubber stamp and craft shop in holborn action and as you probably know they manage to get the young man out from under the car saving his life it s also pretty obvious that these responders needed to observe assess take action and then cycle back through observe this isn t working assess he s still trapped and alive options try different angles get more people involved i m taking off for a long weekend to my parents house so i won t be around until next week hope everyone enjoys their weekend xox right now they are spending the night in a cleaned out drawer of the filing cabinet we want to make sure we can keep them warm through the night but by day they will move into a more spacious box for a little more leg room it s a bit snug but that s new york you gotta live with a little less space bid me come to thee above i remember sharing my insights about data early in my career with a team that saw it differently things soured up pretty quickly i saw myself as part of the team i was keen to hear their voices and add my own to the mix i thought i was valuing their input and they likely thought otherwise i ve now learned to share the data and offer opportunities for my team to engage with it and draw their own conclusions if necessary i now use questions to channel conversations towards important aspects of the data and learn what they think in most situations i ve seen that my team comes up with insights that i have not considered whether or not i agree with them is irrelevant because they have given me something new to think about i ve learned that putting my ideas and opinions on the table is less useful than having my staff make meaning on their own i do add my voice to the mix often by sharing my reflections but i am learning to do this after they have engaged with the ideas and issues have you ever taken a chemistry or physics lab class even in the

christ hello readers crissie from chicasaurus rex here this spring i ve been seeing a lot of greens kelly mint neon and recently pistachio i ve been a fan of pistachio ice cream ever since i was a kid and they served it for dessert at the old spaghetti factory where we only got to go for special occasions of course my next comment might sound familiar to those of you who have been following my blog since the beginning yet at the risk of starting to sound like a broken record i feel i must point it out the movie did follow the book very well but it still missed the essence of what made the book so good once again it seemed like the move was including certain aspects because they were in the book but didn t develop them enough to actually make them mean anything on screen the affair was included but it didn t seem to add anything to the story it felt forced almost part of this could just be that the character development wasn t there in the movie i didn t find myself caring for any of these people so i certainly didn t care that donna was having an affair the same thing could be said about the monster words they were also included in the movie but they were just suddenly there and being used and for someone who hadn t read the book it would certainly have to come across as odd and the whole lottery winning thing was also rushed and forced of course this wasn t something that could have been left out as it was necessary in order to have the cambers be gone when donna and tad come to drop the car off but it sure felt unnatural in the way it was presented once again not having the character development was part of the down fall when mrs camber told joe that she bought him a present now he needed to give her one it just didn t really make any sort of sense at all without knowing all of the background information from the book the line which worked very well in the book actually sounded quite dumb to me in the movie and i even knew said background information it seems like the screenwriter just used whatever he could from the book to make his job easier instead of developing a screen worthy script that could have actually done the book justice since we d

in a school fire in mecca in 2002 after morality police barred them from fleeing the burning building and kept firefighters from rescuing them because the girls were not wearing headscarves and cloaks

thank you tracy a lovely goody bag it was too introducing me to a couple of ranges that are new to me my prize consisted of a wild rose studio paper pack wintry christmas a wild rose studio clear stamp and a pack of kanban self adhesive snowflake stickers the snowflakes are white in real life by the way i have no idea why they have a pinky tone in the photo especially as the other colours are true i ve used some of everything i received on this card i chose three of the lovely co ordinating papers to create the woven corner and added stickles to the dots the lovely stamped image was coloured with promarkers and i used the same star dust stickles on her hat and frosted lace stickles created the snow i then cut the image out with a nesties die the sentiment is from a see d s set and was stamped with brilliance pearlescent lavender ink i thoroughly enjoyed making this and learned something along the way colouring the image while trying to watch australia v the all blacks in a

well like most nine year olds she has a ridiculously active imagination and vision for what she wants to tell however she s not always entirely sure how best to convey it and so she asks me how best to begin or end it being a staunch creative independent shy away from answering i prefer to have her say what she wants and then later refine it with grammatical polishing and such she s quite an artist as well drawing much inspiration from the same catalysts as me often she ll be sparked by a drawing and be compelled to write something or vice versa she possesses such a creative knack virtually world building much in the same way that i do she even shares similar tastes in reading scary stories science fiction comedy and mystery i am proudly impressed with her i and thou lover thee

degradation through education and training in sustainable animal production raising public awareness first are these values enough some might raise the valid criticism that these values sound like clichés however it is the communities themselves that ought to decide in line with heifer s mission the host community is given space to decide and determine their need and develop a concrete plan for achieving their goals but how big is this space it seems that communities are asked as families to join together to define needs set goals and participate in managing their projects as far as is possible it is critical that at the very beginning a project such as hpsa develops a strategic clear plan of action time is certainly important during this development of such a plan so for up to three years staff board and community members are all obliged to participate in this planning this may define partnership in this regard heifer works in productive partnership with civic groups

debatable however if we are truly trying to do the will of the father because he is the one who sent us why do we always try to do things on our own i guess i should just be speaking for myself but

is a fun storybook by matthew mcelligott the book tells of an ant attending the animal king s dinner party where each guest takes half of what is left of the cake until the ant has only crumbs to try to share with the king appalled she offers to bake the king a cake and the animals then take turns trying to top each other s offers each offering to bake double the number of cakes of the previous

told for the last few weeks that he has to be 8 to get a hamster all of the books and stores recommend at least that age before becoming an owner so i was trying to buy time however i am admitting that i am a sucker and when i started to ask kyan about other things he wanted for presents he asked if he could celebrate his birthday in the summer because maybe he would be closer to 8 and could get the hamster then he also brought up the fact that he plays t for teen games and he doesn t get in trouble even though that is breaking the rules sooooooo how could i argue plus in kyan s defense he is very responsible and if any 7 year old could take care of a hamster it is him you ll note that the first entry was for a sampling of the red chair ipa not the red chair nwpa the ipa was part of

commonwealth act no 671 should be construed to mean any emergency resulting from or that is the effect of the last war and not the war emergency itself and that therefore it is for the president to determine whether at the time of the promulgation of the executive orders under consideration such emergency still existed because such contention would make act no 671 unconstitutional or violative of the provisions of section 26 article vi of the constitution this constitutional precept distinguishes war emergency from any other national emergency such as an economic depression and others which may be the effect of a war and empowers the congress in times of war and other national emergency to be determined by congress itself as we have already said and shown to authorize the president for a limited period that may short or of the same duration but not longer than that of the emergency to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out the policy declared by the congress in order to meet the emergency to construe commonwealth act no 671 as contended would be to leave the determination of the existence of the emergency to the discretion of the president because the effects of the war such as those enumerated by the respondents are not determined or stated in said act and could not have been foreseen by the assembly in enacting said act and because it would make the delegation of powers for an in definite period since such an emergency may or may not become depression effect of the first world war took place in the year 1929 or about ten years after the cessation of hostilities in the year 1919 and by no stretch of imagination or intellectual gymnastics may the failure of the congress to appropriate funds for the operation of the government during the period from july 1 1949 to june 30 1950 and to defray the expenses in connection with the holding of the national election on the second tuesday of november 1949 be considered as an emergency resulting from the

26 350 a few hours before closing yesterday i have one writer friend who suggested once we should have a writers exchange of family stories so that those who used them in novels would not be identifiable as sources by said families we haven t done it but it s an interesting idea and so we circle back to being grateful for everything i am truly grateful for everything the good the horrible and that middle ground we tend to ignore like most i learn best from my mistakes and poor choices today i am grateful for all of those mistakes unfortunate life experiences and bad choices for if i had not had them i would not be who i am today embrace your mistakes and bad choices and see just how far they ve brought you someone from the facility called my brother our family s designated contact right away he called another brother and each posted a rest in peace message on facebook at about 9 30 as i was just getting up a childhood friend saw one of the facebook posts and called her 99 year old mother once my mom s best friend who called me she said something about my dad finding peace and what a nice man he always was and i said thanks i knew that she knew he was dying that s how i took her message then i looked at facebook rest in peace robert f peterson would seem fairly unambiguous but it took a couple of calls before i could reach a brother who confirmed that dad had died it s only a tiny part of the story but it s a comment on our times when he got bad news in the middle of the night my brother turned to facebook to make a quick declaration of his feelings and because facebook really is a network a friend called her mom who called me i can marvel over that and even be amused by it and it doesn t have any impact on the bigger story the fact that my dad who never expected to live to age 65 has died peacefully at 95 in a setting where he was loved and supported and so were we all this i think is the easiest of these issues to deal with really folks aren t gays human too aren t they just as deserving of human rights as anyone else and none of that but it s not natural crap as any self respecting scientist will tell you unnatural acts are impossible by definition now walking through the air from rooftop to rooftop would be an unnatural act are you whom i assume want to be considered rational really willing to admit that that you ve gotten all bent out of shape over things that don t even exist perhaps you think that science is just another tool of satan being used to trick us into doing evil well something is doing the trick alright but perhaps we should look a little closer to home in our search for the villain the fact is that homosexuals bisexuals and gender bending have always existed and not just amongst us humans get over it there

norenzayan s research is based on the idea that we possess two different ways of thinking that are distinct yet related understanding these two ways which are often referred to as system 1 and system 2 may be important for understanding our tendency towards having religious faith system 1 thinking relies on shortcuts and other rules of thumb while system 2 relies on analytic thinking and tends to be slower and require more effort solving logical and analytical problems may require that we override our system 1 thinking processes in order to engage system 2 psychologists have developed a number of clever techniques that encourage us to do this using some of these techniques gervais and norenzayan examined whether engaging system 2 leads people away from believing in god and religion i told

out that everyone s been talking about 3d like it s a fad or a passing thing this movie was in 3d 58 years ago amusingly in the dvd special features produced maybe around 2000 2002 they talk about how

than skilful legal representation by hearing me and supporting me to take my victimisation before a court of law they gave me a public voice to express the devastating consequences of crime the day we went to court and received the acknowledgment and recognition of a judge was transformative for me to have the criminal held accountable to have the system recognise that a crime had been committed and that what had happened to me was completely unacceptable was incredibly significant in helping me to believe once more that i could trust my community now will they end up drafting luck or will

eye out for such adverts at the airport for cheaper options while diagnosing a public figure from his or her public behaviour is unsound psycho diagnostic practice julius malema does demonstrate an almost full house of traits of what diagnosticians call a narcissistic personality disorder narcissistic personality dynamics centre principally around the individual s attempts to shore up a fundamentally inadequate sense of self worth in its most flagrant forms pathological narcissism is most recognisable by an overwhelming projection of a sense of grandiosity ironically though this assertion of grandiosity is usually a function of exactly the opposite in terms of the internal dynamics of the narcissist i e an overwhelming and terrifying doubt often only partially conscious to the narcissist that he or she is of value to others the narcissist s defence is typically to assert forcefully often inappropriately and damagingly the opposite of this internal conviction mccarthy

s office in response to the evil ex s request to review the child support order i feel better now it would be a joy to follow this case closely for its entire duration but alas nama s interest in the case is quite limited nama just wants a declaration that it operated properly last year when it sold the maybourne loans for 800m what nama wants to avoid is a judgment which finds the transfer of the loans was improper find the transaction reversed and possibly face damages however listening to the opening arguments today it seems that there are two issues which may deserve further attention and possibly involvement on nama s part 1 might nama have been able to sell the loans for more than 800m and 2 did the company to whom the loans were advanced act in such a way as to compromise nama s rights as a creditor nama has previously said that it sold the loans for 800m and that was the maximum it could achieve that is patent rubbish the loans if enforced would allow nama to take control of shares in the maybourne group which may have been worth considerably more than 800m in my view nama has a case to answer here to justify the sale price and to demonstrate it has maximised returns for the taxpayer nama might also not be happy to learn of the way in which maybourne apparently sought to deter other interest in the hotels in favour of the barclays that s sums it up 1 440 for a family

human rights were of no concern but sharia rights if that s the right word were of great concern grilled cheese sandwich for people who say that this is the worst hammer dracula film ever made they must have stopped at this 1970 feature and never checked out dracula a d 1972 and then the satanic rites of dracula the last of the hammer dracula features this is the last of the hammer series to feature the count in a gothic setting however in this one the count is back in transylvania and the continuity the series had followed fairly well over the last three films dracula prince of darkness dracula has risen from the grave and taste the blood of dracula is jarred by the fact that at the end of taste the count is left a pile of powdery desiccated blood in london scars does have the count start off as powdery blood but there are some a couple gaps here we will look at later the film was shot on a budget and shot quickly it was released sometimes on a double bill with horror of frankenstein only a few months after taste the blood of dracula it was director roy ward baker s first stab at a gothic film and the absence of such maestros of the style like terence fisher or freddie francis is sorely felt but to be honest ward does the best he can with a script that offers very little in the way of something new to add to the series and a small budget and tight schedule he just does not have the flair that terence fisher had but those are pretty big shoes to try and fill in the first place but actually since we re on the subject do you have any writing rituals hugh

1990 assessments which were quickly deflated as soon as we began the hostilities in 1991 which exposed the iraqis as unable to defend themselves at all from our devastating sea air and ground attacks thus the january 1991 debates both in congress and in the country at large should have been far less concerned about the casualties we would suffer and much more concerned about the slaughter we would inflict upon the iraqis so i reorganised part of the dresser and it now looks like this i really will get around to painting it one day honest not sure about the mirror there but i got given it last

viewer needs to be aware of right away the film is absolutely not characteristic of the company s future work and this like the film s unconventional plotting is almost entirely an accident of history that this should be the case even so it threw me to come in expecting a snotty over the top parody and get instead something as nasty in spirit as this even though the sprawling redneck caricatures of

dislike most doctors they base everything on research and their status as experts rather than inquiring about how the patient feels and what we think they assume we have nothing to contribute this

lenny is one of an interesting case from taking a random trip with his kids to upstate new york with a woman and her boyfriend he barely knows to drugging his kids when he is forced to work a late shift as a movie theater projectionist with near disastrous results to getting himself thrown into the slammer when he s caught tagging during a late night out on the town with a couple of male buddies here is a man who acts like he is a slave to his child like self centered and stubborn whims that child like quality though paradoxically makes the character for all the problematic behavior he displays in the film strangely magnetic as bronstein plays him he exudes a strangely charming openness to life a sense of genuine wonder amidst the grungy environment in which he lives skillfully captured in 16mm by brett jutkiewicz and josh safdie at its best the film itself exudes a similarly warm feeling sometimes whimsically zeroing in on side characters a homeless beggar here a chinese restaurant owner there unimportant to the story but simply there to provide lively textures to lenny s world that even lenny himself is too self absorbed to perceive the day after the wedding favor is done i went on a vacation for a week on early may to ny yes it was a while ago and work was super hectic before i left and right after i came back that always happens doesn t it i came back with a severe windburn from nyc which i got on the first day on my vacation it finally healed up a week after i got back from my vacation but never again i go out of the house sun or no sun without sunblock everywhere it was a painful experience but other than that everything was great we ate constantly visited many bakeries and we certainly walk a lot the first 4 days in ny wasn t very nice it was so cold rainy windy so not a good weather to stroll around but it got better on the last day we stayed so we took the oppotunity to bike around the central park we also went to dc to visit the national mall fortunately it was a good day in dc warm and sunny and we did bike around the monuments i will post pictures later after i got to it we played at one of the parks in our neighborhood for an hour

the concentration camp in which 15 of afrikaners from both republics died there is a little less chaos too we get a kind of resolution to the mysteries and the book feels doubly thin as a result even the opening and closing lines always a matter of meticulous attention for ellis seem less than heroic like the similarly pointless friday the 13th a glossy gory remake of a 1970s horror that serves

proud of what i am doing and what i m accomplishing i am glad i am taking care of my life right now and pushing myself forward on the right track i will say however that my situation is just that mine i don t judge anyone s life and i don t want anyone judging mine i know of the mistakes i made i made them as someone who was the caregiver for two aging parents both of whom lived into their nineties i found feeding mrs moskowitz and the the caregiver two stories by barbara pokras and fran pokras yariv 19 95 syracuse university press softcover a delightful experience it is a candid and humorous look at aging with 4 3 million americans now taking on the role of caregivers to loved ones there are plenty of stories to tell and share the book is two novellas in which we meet golde moskowitz an elderly russian born widow living alone with her memories and in the second we visit a fictional upscale assisted living facility in hollywood and learn about it through the eyes of ofelia hernandez a young latina caregiver who relates the lives of those living there it is well worth reading whether one is a caregiver or not aging or not this is a slice of life worth visiting a sacred walk dispelling the fear of death and caring for the dying 15 95 a a publishing softcover by donna m authers addresses the fact that all of us will die at some point and that all of us will be called upon to help a parent spouse friend or other loved one make the final journey helping them make the most of their last years months or weeks can provide priceless memories despite the fact that it will

important creative worship like singing dancing painting or writing are important but worship is so much more than those things it s a heart attitude why you don t even holler for some reason i didn t initially investigate any further into her catalogue but then one friday at work i was talking to another friend who loved ann peebles the next day on my way into town to the shops i decided i simply had to buy a peebles record my first stop was reckless in berwick st which still had a basement where a box of soul singles sat on the counter having inherited not only my dad s hoarding tendencies but his acute sense of relative value i ve never bought many 7 s or 45s as we must trendily refer to them now and 9 10 times i deliberately avoid looking beyond the lp and 12 sections in any shop i was on a mission this time though and miraculously as i began to flick there it was second record in the box as if i d just willed it there i excitedly parted with my 3 and while i have no memory of what if anything else i bought that day i remember it was definitely raining getting the record home i had a bonus discovery with the equally brilliant b side part of whose intro is the backbone to a gza track i was a bit obsessed with at the time a huge proportion of early rza production relies on the hi back catalogue in contrast to the a side the song is much more positive than its title indicates she s bidding goodbye to her troubles and sadness or rather as is more customary for peebles telling them to piss off as iran reigned downed hundreds of thousands of missiles on locations around the middle east they also take out the us navy build up in the persian gulf by firing torpedoes from their underwater silos as us military commanders are dumbfounded as to where the torpedoes are coming from unlike the emp missiles strikes word of these attacks reached back to the homeland after the naval threat was neutralized iran deployed thousands of sea mines into the gulf and shuts

ready he stared at me like it would be our last meeting but i wasn t worried he d been too much a part of this play to go missing before the final act onward eco soldier you gotta wonder sometimes amidst all the contradictions and the mystery yeah you do i sat there with my arms around her hugging her 18 i live in the house of my dreams in tranquil surroundings filled with love a blessed family and happy kids soak things up label culpri yes my marathon running outfit i would like to wear something that makes me feel great endurance events are a mental battle not just a physical one and if there s anything that i can do to add a bit more positivity to the day then i m going to do it so i ve been having a look round a few websites checking out the options there s some lovely kit out there and far more choice than when i was a middle distance running teenager here s a few things i found on sweatshop my favourite running gear website here s the second spice mix in my series of homemade seasoning blends the first one was roasted chicken seasoning which is actually a good all purpose seasoning with poultry and pork now i ve moved onto a fish seasoning for seafood this is my version of old bay seasoning which was inspired by an about com recipe i removed the salt containing spices in their recipe and altered some of the proportions of some of the spices and or herbs to my taste i first used this when making some trout that i crusted with macadamia nuts i won t be posting that recipe for now because it was one of those cases where is tasted a lot better than it looked the nuts wouldn t stick to the fillets so i scooped them out of the pan on top of each serving of fish the taste was amazing but the look left something to be desired if i figure out a more manageable way to make that recipe that does not compromise the flavor i will post it except that i never did get to meet cobain i never even saw nirvana perform live in concert i still regret that a little i was 20 years old still living with my mother when kurt loder solemnly reported it on mtv news i d just worken up i was working graveyard shifts at a donut shop and so i slept in the midday it was a of a thing to wake up to i couldn t believe it at first but he kept saying it i burst into tears and i was a wreck by the time my younger brother came home from school kurt cobain died i told him he killed himself i have been thinking more and more how i need to get back to my first novel and begin rewriting it out of all the novel drafts i have produced over the past two years that first one has the best storyline so far of course i ll go back and fix up the second and third novels after the first one has been rewritten now i understand why it takes so long to get novels into presentable form life just keeps coming around orange fresh mandarin oranges and carrots so as to the solace i am keeping up with the housekeeping and that is making a huge difference i didn t spend yesterday morning cleaning up all of my mess from the week all i had to do was a little laundry change the sheets run the dishwasher and clean up the kitchen so minimal my mom said it s like found time and it truly is

private oasis while visiting the park my dad keeps reminding me that it has been over a month since i have blogged it is so nice to have a fan tacita dean says that she needs film as an artist needs paint so unexpectedly a routine standup and shout turned out to be something more important though what that was perhaps was according to how you saw it a call to arms the mustering of an army a battle charge the last rites a wake or a re birth of the medium into a new life in a rather different world where it s no longer taken for granted as the medium of transmitting stories but defined by

comparable to life you start off at an easy terrain which gets harder as you move forward there s some bumps on the road that you have to cross some are small where you don t have to try as hard while others need more thought on how you will get from point a to point b during your journey you have to take breaks get yourself back together find your balance and strength to carry forward you see other people taking different paths and you think should i follow that or should i take my own you have friends with you looking back and checking if you re ok or vice versa and then when you finally reach your goal you take your time to appreciate it you soak in how great it feels to finally make it then you turn around and do it all over again fc and mech wanted to go to soderno and have manang

the guys mostly talked in fulfulde and occasionally asked me a few questions in english about obama and american education culture sulemanu told me that when a baby is born if the family is wealthy enough they slaughter a cow we ate bread and dipped it into a beef broth made from the cow when the broth ran low we used forks to eat chunks of beef left over in the bowl this was the first time since i ve been here that i had to remember to always eat with my right hand the man is a christian church goer in wouram but comes from a muslim background so i didn t want to do anything impolite we also ate avocados there were two avocados that were cut into quarters and we used spoons to scoop the fruit out we drank hot tea with sugar at first and then cold milk they said the milk was from a cow so i imagine that it was genuine milk not the milk we typically have which is water mixed with dried milk powder i am the author of a fantasy romance trilogy kingdom of arnhem woman of honor 2009

you on my new life and i doubt i will be able to resist the urge to comment on world affairs particularly where they affect stockport and what about that financial insecurity this is another dreaded thing i hear about from clients friends and of course all over the news how can financial insecurity possibly be a good thing again as shakespeare s hamlet said there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so what did i learn from radical financial insecurity that my true security comes from some place else true security doesn t come from money a career what kind of car i drive or even if i drive true security comes from knowing that i can seek and find whatever i need at any given moment in my life to communicate how devastating sexual abuse is and to encourage others to seek help and to express themselves also i wanted the images to be therapeutic while using readily available supplies and producing the images as simple as possible a couple of days ago i was checking a dancing activity where the kids are supposed to jump up turn around and clap it is true that a lot of japanese people have trouble distinguishing between l and r do you see what i m getting at yep there it was in big letters across the top of the page workbox file 12 family project make egyptian jewelry items in ziploc bag and rouses a murder of crows this months theme is seduced by chocolate i did wonder if i could resubmit last months recipe in case you missed it it was devils food cake was about as chocolaty you could get but that would be cheating instead i made a variation on a recipe that was featured in nigella s feast book my favourite appropriately provost peter lange strongly and publicly criticized the original version of baker s racist screed i was seriously pissed off with a few people this weekend a minority of people thankfully but way more than i d want to deal with i m talking about the up the punx types who don t give a about any of the politics or helping the scene in any way whatsoever just proving how totes punk they are the thing is it s not just not giving a it s one thing to not be interested in politics it s another entirely to actively try to ruin the work of people who are it s one thing to not be able to want to put gigs on or get involved in the legwork of the scene it s another to act like such a fucking arsehole that the promoters who do put gigs on might not be able to in future if mangoes are well and truly gone from your local grocery experiment with other fruit bananas oranges or even grapefruit for example marvin gaye i heard it through the grapevine us how have you been the kids could not play outside thankfully and i feel cooped up already the scraping of the snow the crunching of the snow it is just icky and because it was 50 degrees yes you read that right on sunday the piles of old snow have melted and become this dark black icy mix of who knows what i m feeling pretty nervous but excited at the same time i know i can do it even the last person across still gets to say they did it right i kinda think that the runners tomorrow are going to be pretty fast they all looked so hardcore at the package pickup today ha ha i

that i haven t been posting lately because i haven t been dancing a lot lately without getting into too much detail i was very ill towards the end of the year no i was not contagious my sickness took a toll on not only my joints but also my eyes i tried lying to myself saying it s not that bad and pressing on through the discomfort but denial is not a good substitute for the truth 2 24 12 banff ab banff centre live long and prosper i printed out each comment that was left as an entry to this contest and nicole drew the winner which is so that s what i ve been working on aside from purchasing new couches we asked the anesthesiologist why we were not told about this treatment before he said it is becoming more commonly used for the treatment of atypical trigeminal neuralgia he has had good results with other patients the beyond category hopes to bring out new visual and conceptual forms of communication and art which catalyse social change while engaging people as something more than mere consumers saint peter addresses this guy who are you so that i may know whether or not to admit you to the kingdom of heaven i am sending this query to you because if not for the courage lacks a single protagonist and thus isn t amenable to the standard query letter template so if i can get your attention with this query i know i m on the right track man s answer to the vagina monologues the guardian in very early pregnancy flutters are felt these develop into stronger thumping movements let me just work it out oh yes call it 48 000 000 that ll do we do have a mobile phone but that is

departure from the rest of the music i ve posted on these lists so far but the bubbly effervescence of regina spektor is the antithesis of summer with friends for me maybe it s because i bought the album far right before otakon last year and spent the entire twelve hour round trip drive blasting it out the open windows with one of my closest friends of all time either way two birds is a great track that suits days lying on the beach where sweat sticks sand to your biceps and calves even before you set a single toe in the surf the all attractive always has all these and many others great qualities no one else can ever hope to possess such greatness he is the flag of good qualities and the palace of beauty herself i lament because i have just been robed of him now i see the ills of kali in the world it was only after she made up her version that i knew what my wool fabric was destined for i would make another wrap top from advance 7701 but this time in wool a kind of kimono cardigan as a further little twisty turn in the life of this pattern steph has now created her very own kimono wrap top pattern using the original vintage pattern as a starting point her pattern is available for sale on craftsy i can t tell you how happy this makes me a prior engagement kept me away from saturday s game so i have relied on the first hand accounts of those present at stoneham park on saturday morning to piece this report together ryan hurst was first to reply to my text message he too was unable to play although his absence rather unfortunately was due to an ankle injury he sustained in wednesday s game with sporting bishops waltham this meant we were without our first choice centre halve pairing against wessex league opponents as kev willsher was also missing having torn a shoulder muscle on wednesday although hurst s text didn t confirm the final score it did heavily imply that we had lost we battled well but so many playing out of position but was very much the operative word and after some coaxing hurst did confirm that we had lost the game 5 2 although what was rather more telling was that we were three goals down in the opening three minutes forgive me fashion gods for i was blind it wasn t until a week ago that i realized the genuineness of them i doubt that designers came up with them to help people like me though let me explain the word that resounds through brecht s text like a knell is nothingness baal is the eye of the storm the passive genius who absorbs the vacuum around him and in parallel with his hideous description of childbirth as the agonised expulsion of something that was received with pleasure ejects it as a monstrous nullity the poetry he creates lyrical celebrations of disgust is almost a by product of this process it neither redeems nor excuses him and in fact he asks neither of it this is where his innocence exists and is why even towards the end despite his vile behaviour his friend eckhardt calls him a child his one virtue if he can be said to have any is that his actions however selfish lack the pettiness of self interest so congratulations to dee ranged or whatever your real name is for creating a truly terrible letter i ve copied it so everyone else can also appreciate the wretchedness on thursday i ll dissect all of the things besides the rhyme that is wrong with this letter so i ve spent the last 7 days in seattle on my honeymoon understandably many things are swirling and mixing around in my heart and mind for one i m married and this takes more time to transition than i thought it would but it is good i m also on the hunt for a job i ve been waiting tables for the past month or two something i never thought i d do again but something i m really enjoying and interviewing for teaching positions among other pursuits i ve been offered a couple things but have yet to accept anything and i m fairly confused kp yeah actually what i did was i used a kickstarter campaign for the artwork manufacturing and promotion of the album so it was more for post album details they re interesting questions what does it mean to live for example have i ever skied or surfed no in some people s eyes then i haven t lived then again other people might live to ski or surf and if they can t they might feel that they haven t lived what does living mean and the corn its proud emblem or love this is 4

return to a normal life look here s the envelope spirituality and healing i agree in all relationships boundaries need to be created you may even have to train teach people what good behavior is because many may not even know sometimes it works okay it s a bad joke but it s still funny dammit so i m stick with gina which i m not entirely comfortable with for one thing it s not technically the right term i think i m not sure i could pass a test if i had to label all the parts down there anyway well except for clitoris there s a lot of things in this world things we see every day things that have an incredible impact on our daily lives so closing went really well we got there at 9 30am and we were out by 11am our cashiers check was actually for 20 too much so they sent us home with a 20 check made me feel rich considering we had just given them a huge chunk of change norway film award english cr i learnt a lot from my collaboration with brook and abbado i was young enough 23 years old and could absorb all that an artist has to learn after studying the vocal technique for years searching for perfection from abbado i learnt the interpretative musical rigour the mozart style that must be impeccable and cogent but also rich in musical nuances and thousand of colours and then the use of the word and the consonant in the recitative from brook i learnt a very important thing he would always repeat us during a whole year of don giovanni on tour performance forget you are an opera singer i cried at this at the beginning then i understood that by detaching from myself i would let the right space for the character to seize me and the voice would come out more freely still now when i am on stage i am donna anna for three hours i cry i love give way to despair as she would do finally i come back to carmela only in my dressing room he taught me that freedom is truth on stage and this has to go through minimalism and simplicity rkdwv blog rkdwvblog wordpress com is a

when they need me we are not all ready to change and if it s not self motivated it s not going to happen so i want to ask you harold nicolson 1 the compassion of jesus the word that is used for compassion in the new testament is the greek word splagchna it is the word used to describe the deep innermost part of a person the heart the lungs the liver and the intestines these were thought by the greeks to be the seat of the emotions the word stands for the emotion that moves a person from the very depths of his or her being they say our religious practices are backwards so i m sitting here at my desk and i can see the stack of stuff piled up to work on out of the corner of my eye right in plain sight and i simply cannot touch it i do not want to balance the checkbook or update my mileage log or work on papers for the accountant to prepare the tax return i just cannot go there in this frame of mind after 2 and a half years of trying in vain my girlfriend and i have finally found our own apartment we re in the process of packing up and all that nice stuff which is why posting has been lacking unfortunately for the blog i won t have internet access in the apartment at first so there might not be any updates on the blog for a while i m hoping it ll only be for a month at the least luckily we ve been smart with the cash so we are able to get internet eventually but just not right away so fellow custards one book of my life closes and a new one opens hopefully you will all understand and appreciate why the blog will be bare for a small bit go ahead and only take a minute if that s appropriate but skip using the phrase just a minute in a talk or presentation it sounds apologetic and implies that you don t think what you are about to say is worthy of time and attention with the avengers coming out this weekend it seems like all of the giddy youngsters action happy teens and die hard nerds will all be flocking to the theaters so what about the older peeps out there well they get junk like this that goes for anything a technique a pattern a cutting method a design if you teach it expect it to be used for any reason is this something that you may interested in do you already post wrap up style posts on your blog whether weekly or monthly at the first line he read his face i have been noticing while creating over the past few days that i have been stepping outside my box a little bit and have really enjoyed putting different textures patterns and colors together it is a ton of fun while nibbles will work for schools and story times about conservation ecology and gardening it s not a didactic message book told in bright and cheerful pictures nibbles has a dilemma loss of his favorite food and achieves both long and short term solutions that make sense good morning all my lovelies how are you all i have a poorly 16 year old at the mo he has a bad chest infection so he s on antibiotics as well as his inhaler cus he has asthma but its ok he has his xbox lol moneyball renews your belief in the power of movies wearing a new outfit c the true world but who is it really who tells us that the apparent world must be of less value than the true one does our instinct not contradict this judgment does man not eternally create a fictitious world for himself because he wants a better world than reality above all how do we arrive at the idea that our world is not the true world it could be that the other world is the apparent one in fact the greeks thought of e g a shadow kingdom an apparent existence beside true existence and finally what gives us the right to posit as it were degrees of reality this is something different from an unknown world it is already a wanting to know something of the unknown the other the unknown world very good but to say true world means to know something of it that is the opposite of the assumption of an x world sure there are plenty of people that feel that a croissant is a croissant there are plenty of people that cannot appreciate a good macaron and there are even people who may not even like macarons but bouchon brings pastries to the next level in my humble opinion and every trip brings something different for me to try and something different for me to take to go so i can bring it home and enjoy it tomorrow more vacay pics for your monday all these qualities together and way of life transmitted through generations for the welfare of people expressed through language and actions are included in culture in case you haven t noticed i ve sort of been missing for a few weeks

positive way thank you huston street 3 4 war 2 points dab dab layer layer on the other hand one who has received the transcendental knowledge by aural reception from the bona fide preceptor in the disciplic chain and who has sincere regard for the real ācārya must needs be enlightened with the revealed knowledge of the vedas but this knowledge is permanently sealed to the cognitive approach of the empiricists as it is said in the śvetāśvatara upaniṣad 6 23 the first time i walked into mcsorley s old ale house and asked for a bottle of bud was years ago and i was informed that they only sold their own ale as a matter of fact mcsorley s has only sold it s own ale since it opened it s doors in 1854 as another matter of fact the one big change that did take place required a decision from the supreme court that being the admittance women the feminist landmark decision forced the bar to finally install a female rest room by 1986 but other than that little has changed nothing has been removed from the walls since 1910 and souveniers from visitors past include handcuffs from harry houdini a chair that abraham lincoln sat in when he visited in 1859 and wish bones left by soldiers during world war i those wishbones that remain are of soldiers who never returned to take them back you too waking up at 7 00am on a sunday morning just doesn t seem right it s probably that i don t want to miss anything or that i m missing something two cups of civet coffee later yes i m still drinking that cat poop coffee i m a little wired pondering the day and reflecting on the week that flew by i know some of you must be saying omgosh this woman is slow lol i do take a good bit of time on my armatures i start with twisted wire and then put it in the shape that i want then i wrap the wire with white florist tape as i m wrapping i am also building out areas like the shoulders hiney and such i have discovered that i don t have to use as much clay when i actually shape the armature a bit more once it is all taped i apply a thin layer of white glue ya know plain old school glue works wonders this gives the armature added strength plus it gives a better surface for the clay to adhere to but it was vile and it was cheap i don t know about you but after re living the tragedy of september 11th 2001 through the 10 year anniversary coverage this weekend i m ready for an uplifting monday there s been a series of emails firing back and forth through our department this morning discussing the possibilities here and what has been pointed out by graeme eagles something of an expert in plate motions is that the india australia plate is under a really acute stress regime as it gets split into 3 and twisted that leads to these large build ups and eventual release under strike slip do they talk about mediumship in a dramatic or weird way the book gives a broad overview of how the current copyright monopoly is starting to degrade free speech and people s privacy internet censorship proposals have become commonplace and alleged pirates are punished without due process all without any clear evidence that more stringent measures actually cause a decline in piracy learning engages the whole body the study was based on answers to the general social survey which began asking people about their level of trust in various public institutions including congress and the supreme court in the 1970s the dip in trust toward the scientific community didn t correlate to a decrease in trust for all political institutions since conservatives showed increased trust in political institutions during the bush presidency but still found science suspicious coming of age was originally part of the third story in the chloe trilogy i d like to publish the others so here i ll be vague about the content for the first part a friend s comment prompted a story about chloe s punishment caning it s still one of my favorite masturbation fantasies i presented the story to my friend as a gift and planned to end things there but when she mentioned an upcoming shopping trip my muse poked me again and its beyond amazing i will also be teaching there in late sept in the index to part of the crane archives there s a card that says map paper there are several requests from map makers and printers about whether crane papers would be appropriate for maps but i ve never seen a map on crane paper until just a few days ago honey prairie complex fire ga as for smiles if you call yourself my friend still considering the total dickhead that i have been recently then chances are i love you unconditionally but only if you want me to of course randy was born in 1958 in fort coulonge quebec a small lumber town in his childhood he developed a debilitating neuromuscular disorder from what i can recall i had a normal and well adjusted childhood i had two brothers we got along well even though things got a little rowdy at times we looked out for each other getting texts rachel held evans spoke recently at a mission planting conference about her upcoming book a year of biblical womanhood where she said i believe the bible is meant to be a conversation starter not a conversation ender i need to get the tiller going and get everything tilled under a couple times before planting time come around i had the chickens in the garden to tear everything up and add a little fertilizer before i moved them back to the yard but i will probably buy a little bit of manure and maybe some compost to add to soil i should plant a cover crop but i never get around to it and now for something completely different i ended up in seattle with thomas kemper where i was recruited to go to hong kong the rest is history this is a great cast and there are certainly laughs to be had in the pilot i especially liked the team trying to figure out ways to stop the vp s retard gaffe getting on the front page what if tom hanks dies but i simply need to spend more time with the series hbo doesn t give you easy to digest comedies they give you series that take more time to work out take the series that occupied this timeslot last week eastbound down it was a comedy series i was initially put off by but the more time i put into understanding that world and getting to know those characters the more i got out of it because i better understood what the show was trying to do this is of course rather

gums bleed but getting them jabbed with their alien prodding devices makes it look like you ve been chewing glass i guess if i did actually floss my gums would be all scarred and bled out so this wouldn t happen at least it isn t a week long mouth period like after i got my wisdom teeth out which i even wrote about while i was still loopy from the pain killers i guess the horror stories of what happens when i don t floss aren t strong enough to stop me from forgetting what floss actually is director john gilling cringe i have no time as lady gaga said this must end our generation has

sound of thunder growling away in the distance making me feel extra cozy in my bed i wish that thunder had let to rain but alas not today as a harvard graduate student i came to know numerous radical activists i have posed this questions to many of them and in most cases only heard that a new way has to be found or that it is impossible to understand the socialist future when living under capitalist conditions other activists however told me that they are not against the state as such only against the nation state that distinction is however irrelevant because what they criticize in the nation state is first and foremost its power to command penetrate and control unfortunately power is just the aspect of the state that they need in order to implement their projects the dream of social equality requires more power more coercion and more ideological indoctrination to enforce it so even if the nation state will be abolished and another unidentified state will rise from its ashes it will still have to exercise power lots and lots of power in order to implement social projects so we are back at point zero and the paradox remains acute as ever szobody claims these young

and age groups to watch a short video that showed numerous examples of violence against african americans while three mannequins a man a woman and a child stood in the display case next to me outfitted in ku klux klan outfits i had seen these types of films before but not in this context i was honestly moved almost to tears by the sadness and disgust that i felt as i watched the video and am convinced that the only reason i didn t shed any tears was because i was equally angry that people can be so vile and hateful because of a person s skin color as the video ended i looked around at the rest of the crowd and recognized varied looks of sadness anger and stunned disbelief after taking a moment to compose myself i turned my attention to the aforementioned kkk display and was moved to sadness and anger all over again the display talked about the role of women men and children in white supremacist organizations like the kkk and i found it quite fitting that this trio that looked like a family stands together looking out at the lynching tree seeing as i learned about how lynchings were family social gatherings are you kidding me how messed up is that i guess i shouldn t have

rear ride heights but do not suggest how the car may be able to run that low but the inference is that the splitter is in someway deflecting to allow this i ve not seen the detail of red bulls

neckbrace productions back in early september of 2007 i visited new orleans to see how the city was doing two years after hurricane katrina one of the restaurants i visited was parasol s an old irish

why do we wait for the mertons and hulls of the world what i would or could about desire certainly the last of these doesn t apply to me we ve got a job the 1963 birmingham children s march is my debut book that s after all why i ve been a member of emu s debuts so for these purposes the book was birthed by a parent as nameless as a low class dickensian character nevertheless i have a sense that this book is taking on a life of its own so much so that zombie images have come to mind it seems to be marching appropriately into newspapers blogs emails stores and conversations without my presenting it to society accompanied by a proper introduction as would be expected of an upper class dickensian character kyle narrowly escapes when his airplane crashes on take off only to find himself stranded 2 000 miles from home in a country that has been forced from a technological standpoint back to the 19th century confused hurt scared and alone kyle must make his way across a hostile

its slow spiral into chaos and anarchy this one surprised me again a collective that owns a couple breweries but i had no idea that their production was this high strangely redhook longhammer ipa taps do seem to pop up everywhere i ve even seen one in a southwest terminal at the kansas city airport being sold right next to cans of tallgrass buffalo sweat either there are a lot more people drinking redhook than i thought or they just have some very aggressive sales reps that have scored accounts all over the place as i look more and more into alternative families i do wonder sometimes about the displacement of the dad for example i know a guy who is the father to a baby for two lesbians he s a straight guy and the one lesbian was his best friend so he donated his man stuff for her the kid knows him but he is definitely known as more of a super uncle he s super uncle jim since jim is a poet and has an unstable living situation this is a great arrangement for him he sees the kid when he wants and gets to be a dad on the side but what about the gay men who do not want to be dads on the side sure they can adopt or have their own kids via a surrogate but i think a lot of times they get left out of the alternative family building process because chicks still own their uteruses even though the government often thinks they own them but that s a subject for another post by another

all the character development of the individual members of the village and wondered if i would be required to learn this all over again in a second book the main feeling i had was get on with it it

meant to happen great series and sadly missed suffering refines the church and each one of her members so as to strengthen their faith trials and tribulations will in fact produce steadfastness in our hearts as we endure to the end james 1 2 god ordains suffering so as to refine our faith and teach us to truly trust in and rely on him we are proven to be true christians by our steadfastness in our confidence in christ and our boasting in our hope in him through suffering hebrews 3 6 do not be mistaken suffering will most definitely come our way sometimes in very harsh and hurtful ways however evidence of those who are truly partaking of christ s salvation will endure to the end genuine believers will not become hardened to the truth and hope of the gospel during suffering but instead persevere god uses trials and suffering to display and identify 1 his true church perseverance through suffering for the christian will produce a confidence and assurance in their faith and hope in christ for salvation one can therefore self identify if they are true believers or not if during suffering they harden their hearts against god and turn from him they may not be true believers since true believers will persevere in faith and obedience even through suffering as they are empowered by christ to do so he won a grammy in 1980 for his album la onda va bien capping off a career that

our concert will be held soon i m so excited i can t wait to meet our fans pure unadulterated joy is such a great feeling i hate ptsd i hate that it took him i hate that i forgot to tread lightly and look for the tell tale signs that his mood was not matched with mine i hate that he knows i wasn t being a but he can t help himself and i hate that he is still intentionally hurting me with the word whore i hate the war i hate i dunno i hate that he hates me but can t live without me i hate that he doesn t know if he wants me to stay or go i hate that i am settling for being hated i hate that i don t know if i m even allowed to feel any of this and maybe i shouldn t because most people actually have to live in the same space as it i hate that i feel like a phony and i hate that i feel useless hubby no and i sleep the sleep of the just i devour the sensation my brain works out my problems while my body comfortably rests and restores in a sweet smelling bed in a sunlit room two hours in the end i dream of a beautiful white room walled with clear sun streaming windows a sparkling wide stretching wood floor smooth and perfectly clean empty of furniture it is an image of my mind stillness loveliness order replace confusion serenity relief fueled by alcohol and hormones which powder foundations have you tried and loved i arrived in california on friday getting picked up by a most wonderful friend of my mother s kathy she and her husband were super awesome and took me for chinese dinner then a mini game of thrones marathon before dropping me off at kick off the next morning kimberlee kidd barista i was traumatised meanwhile father of the year is nearly ending himself laughing and holly is giving me a row for dropping litter i had to put it somewhere okay quit judging me for example if you question the unmitigated benefits of multiculturalism you are decried as a racist if you suggest that any section of the community other than the white community might possibly have undesirable behavioural or social characteristics you are a racist in fact if you demonstrate anything short of total surrender to the cult of enrichment that in itself will automatically render one at risk of shrill accusations of bigotry xenophobia hatred and of course racism we the purveyors of ghosties and other bad things that go bump in the night and scare the bejesus out of us are starving fed a barely palatable diet of uninspired remakes of japanese horror imports and 80s slasher flicks served up with paltry sides of three dimensional gimmicks and computer generated imagery for the past several years and we re malnourished it s no surprise then that we re so hungry for quality so ravenous for something to satiate our horror taste buds that we d pounce like a slobbering alien on the crew of the nostromo on the first promising morsel of original horror cinema that crosses the threshold of our local multiplex always i end up back with my diet mtn dew unfortunately the analysis does not end there i ve been to university i ve studied english literature and teaching at three of europe s most prestigious institutions i ve never even held a real gun let alone used it to pistol whip anyone and do i try hard yes i do try hard there s no doubt about it i m a david caught in a web of sterile self reflection i wouldn t know an engaging story if it came along and shat in my mental toilet so that s my number one pick go dawgs findings of the research will be published in summer 2012 for more information please view the press release i cannot say it enough how happy i am about how this came together i started by making the pinwheels the larger pinwheel is made from a 3 square and the smaller pinwheels are from 2 squares i then used brads to hold them together the sticks are lollipop sticks that i use when i m making candy that i inked using tim holtz broken china i then attached the pinwheels to the sticks at varying heights the grass is a piece of scrap paper that i had and then fringed to make it look more like grass the clouds were cut from one of the pre loaded images on the cricut imagine and then inked with tim holtz broken china everything except for the grass is popped up using pop dots i love those things i use them on almost everything lol annie and snow were also captivating to watch snow made the classic villainous mistake of underestimating annie s intentions towards eve s welfare and it cost him his life i guess this should now mean that the old ones are out of the equation but in this show s effortless methods of adapting i can t wait to see what mr rook and his band of domestic staff are going to bring for the next series it might be nice to have another main big bad that isn t a

designed the invite and used a font that looked like cake decoration piping this is a cute article but as this blog is about language i thought i would suggest we stop being the amygdala and try to be wernicke s area instead beautiful day we need to have more senior people male and female talking openly about the ways in which they carve out time in their lives for their families and of course we need more senior people actually doing it what is rhubarb rhubarb is a perennial vegetable that originated in china eventually being grown in britain and then the us rhubarb was something i had only heard of until i moved to pennsylvania it likes a cooler climate to grow in and shows up in the local markets in the spring until early summer it is quite tart and requires a lot of sugar compared to other fruits i like tart and tangy and rhubarb does not disappoint but my facebook friends are not teen reluctant readers i don t ever accept friend requests from readers so i know they re not i can t imagine how amazon is targeting my facebook friends i assume they re not actually and that they re sending these messages to people who have bought others of my books or searched for them on amazon i

bordello but in a g rated kind of way in this context you can easily imagine you ve walked into the moulin rouge at the turn of the 20th century moving from the lobby to the antique belgian spiegeltent that houses the main performance space it struck me that this could well be the grand ole opry of seattle s kindiependent music scene weakness teams in norfolk st s situation need to be able to shoot the three reasonably well to stay close to higher seeded teams unfortunately for the spartans they don t do that they re only shooting 31 4 percent from behind the arc a stat that has to be troubling for spartan fans who hope their team can spring a monumental upset teams will load up in the paint against the spartans and if they can t shoot from outside they ll be out early below are some video documents of the event which i offer without commentary i had only my phone with me so i recorded what i could on that regrettably i cannot share recordings of the two faculty speakers due to a technical problem those clips lack proper sound fortunately someone else captured them here and here i am so liking red on my cards at the minute and normally i run for the hills with red but not at the moment also i had to use some black to be dramatic and make the image pop the dp is from a capsle collectiion by papermania few red gems some red satin ribbon touch of lace and a whispers

well drawn characters i ve ever read lisbeth salander the girl of the title and a consummate computer hacker and investigator together the chemistry the intelligence the skills combine for what might be called a ripping good yarn and yes it has a couple of pretty grim sections not for the faint of heart but they are essential to the plot not gratuitous and move both story and character along these

he had this air of superiority around him he was brilliant and inspiring it was rumoured that he had a gpa of 4 5 gbenga really inspired me to be the best we stayed up late discussing law politics girls and sports he was a gunner just like i am so you would understand the camaraderie we had he was my egbon in the truest sense of the word the guy you go to when your broke or you need help he was the shoulder i leaned on i ve been writing this post in one form or another since the night of october 31 2009 it s started out a couple of different ways one was a fanciful opening passage to the apocryphal but amusingly un authorized biography of pete carroll i ve been writing in my head since the end of the 2003 orange bowl another was a long and very unnecessary series of musings on the nature of a charmed life it referenced thermodynamics faeries and cold iron seraphim standing in front of operating microwaves charles vess glamors and the play within the play in a midsummer s night dream i suck though those openings didn t work they were a bit pretentious a bit too filigreed maybe they re middle bits but they are definitely not call me ishmael so as always there is vonnegut 5and when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men he was very angry i know many of you saw the diane sawyer 20 20 special children of the plains and i let it pass by without much comment on the blog i had plenty to say but i knew a lot of folks from the community and some of my friends thought it was great so i let it go and didn t think it was really my place to barge in with my super critical lens on the whole thing a couple of days ago you saw hints of what we thought would be warriors cygnus knights revamp but it s actually a new job i m lucky enough to have found a used cycleops bike trainer in used condition on amazon a while only hope that one day you will find the shore to roam who are some of your favorite authors 5 spraying a mist of perfect pearls while you wrought awesome deeds we could not hope for over the next five days the good news was slow going and at times i almost despaired again everyone had all the sympathy in the world for us but no one knew what to do despairing herself the woman at the hospital called down to trenton to ask for help and found out on thursday that she should have called them all along and that they have to authorize such paperwork but that definitely we would be able to bury our daughter god is good because somehow with the help of many hands the mess of paperwork and regulations was finally straightened out and

afternoon was spent at church and i was extremely proud we made it on time but the christmas program was beautiful and it was a nice way to remind our children of the reason for the season can you see lester chambers try to sell himself by putting on a meat suit i can t top with cool whip and wafer crumbs today what i see in south africa is not whites killing blacks but the other way around the truth is that the generation that was indoctrinated with hatred were the blacks who were told to hate whites by the lying communists this hatred is still evident in south african society and is reported daily in beeld and the rest of the sa media where we read about blacks raping torturing high jacking and killing whites every day the exact thing the sadf wanted to prevent who can kill a child doesn t begin right off with its story instead the first ten minutes presents images of dead or dying children in concentration camps and war zones a voiceover tells us that in war and in disasters caused by humans children are the greatest victims millions and millions of children have died because of adult actions it is very easy to come to riga now we have good air connections and

the polishes above are all mny i had a hard choice making my decision though as the mny displays don t ring my bell at all while the illustrations are cute in a nylon type of way the arrangement of colors makes me think of crayons at a daycare center my owner the asian lady rushes at kim and lifts me up and then kablooey i splatter all over kim kardashian a lot of me gets on her very classy looking coat and a little bit of me ends up on her blue shirt it s very soft and nice some of me gets on her face even and i d like to report to you that kim s face is exquisite but the truth is it s

above any career a moment of clarity where clarity most often strikes pinpointed my discontent the blue colour just ruins it providing the visual focus as to why this is simply not an arsenal shirt looking at the long sleeved version i should imagine that even the fancy dans who wear gloves in cold weather will be praying that the tradition of the arsenal captain wearing the sleeves involves the shorter version they are quite simply ghastly oh and when you have explain that the obsidian hoops on the sleeve are blue it is blue unless of course you are disappearing up your own arsenal hole at a

show you how to make them into these cute little hearts they re just perfect for valentine s day and the second from landon last night cody manning and i loaded up after work to go get haircuts from my sister after being at her shop for a couple of hours we rushed out the door and decided on going through the chick fil a drive thru because it was a quick easy choice we wanted to hurry and get little man home because it was already past his bedtime as soon as we got on the highway he drifted off so cody and i enjoyed a peaceful ride home and got to enjoy one another s company for a couple weeks there i kinda got obsessed with picking them and making jam i was not at all impressed with this wine and now for the kitchen right this way so throw open a window and enjoy the week end sacré coeur the sacred heart of jesus basilica is located at the summit of the butte montmartre the highest point in the city now will you let it hang out in your yard ok then here s yet another reason it s delicious stay tuned for some exiting news cozy is on duty with another band somewhere in europe he flies back on thursday and others yielded great stories and information i promised my intrepid co author i was planning on answering a third question but my verbosity has done me in i ve spent parts of four days writing this much and my eyes are pooped from constant squinting and refocusing the other fifteen questions will all get answered sometime in time so until then you ll just have to keep your shorts on please as if i didn t have enough sets on the go i decided to start another one as most of you may know the latest incarnation of in the game s between the pipes was let loose yesterday and yes i will be as always collecting the base set that s a given with summer coming i decided to make some smaller bead embroidered pieces for my etsy shop that are easy to wear with your daily wardrobe i love a statement piece as much as anybody else but i wanted to bring in an element of casual style while still maintaining the unique artistry of bead embroidery inside a church communications survey one word remorse pausing only temporarily to cast their healing magic and in the case of alagon to use his laying on of hands power the party pressed on through the gate and into the tower itself from where they had heard noises which told them that they had not finished off the entire defence force before them lay a room with three possible exits ahead right and left the latter led them to a dingy room in which was a filthy pile of straw and some gnawed and bloody bones to the right was a long vaulted hall at the end of which was an archway through which the party saw two more bugbears coming to investigate the noise of intruders the bugbears hung back enticing the party to come to them unfortunately ferros charged straight through the arch without stopping to wonder why and triggered a flame trap which incinerated the doughty cleric he had lost a lot of hit points in the battle and was still not up to full he also failed a save vs breath and took 4d6 of damage which reduced him to below 10 that by my house rules is permanently dead ossie ans winston the professor it s feasting and football day in any event grits would rather see newspapers make money from adult entertainment than treating news reporting as entertainment which is another common route some outlets have taken to draw in more readership though to its credit mostly not the morning news i don t consider voyeurism about gory personal crime details any more commendable than sexual voyeurism but newspapers have profited from printing salacious crime details for years to save the industry newspaper editors need to get off their high horse or else fall off probably into the unemployment line albeit with their self righteousness and dignity intact so i am trying to use up my scraps so i started with the small square in the right corner it is a floral pattern that matches the stripes from a echo park springtime paperpack since i am using floral papers she is my flower power gal as challenged by joanna sheen i browsed the challenge blogs to find a sketch that would work and found it at sketch saturday i subsituted the ruffled dark purple for a paper in the sketch but i like it i found it a bit challenging to use this sketch because i made this card into an easel card this is only my second time doing an easel don t know why i love them a curious little group of statues down by the harbour and just visible a new venue called the wave centre hosting concerts and community events these things are clear evidence of regeneration whether they are quite to one s taste or not like much of west cumbria maryport has gone though a long decline with prominent high street properties standing empty once it was possible to walk clear across the harbour on the decks of the herring boats an old lady in the nursing home told me those days are long past democracy is fine when there s plenty of money in the kitty but i can t help feeling that some other form of government is needed it times of crisis perhaps the position of dictator as constituted under the roman republic if i were president i would immediately cancel all pensions for retired public sector workers and outlaw public sector unions what a colossal waste of money i really enjoyed this layout so much i pulled it out and played with it again adding some of my favorite images of mgm now known as disney hollywood studios sorry folks at disney it will always be mgm to me lol i just can t get used

realized what the desire of her life is to be and runs through a long curving passageway another classic symbol of transition and birth but the scene is filmed as an endless following shot in the psychedelically orange gateways of the fushimi inari shrine just click through and look and truly delivers on the sensation of transformation that the moment is always easily found before i embedded the box though i cut a hole in the top that would be embedded in the bigger box so when children put the pellets into the big hole some would go into the embedded box after embedding i cut two holes in the box one on the side and one on the top for if we took an interest i am certain that we d find this year boston has been selected and while today will see the official commemoration led by mr higgins a whole series of events will take place throughout the year this saturday is my birthday and while i ve never been one to turn down a celebration whether said celebration takes the form of wine food specifically the three course tasting menu at julienne or a jump out of a perfectly good airplane the past couple of years have seen me less and less inclined to announce my birthday or more to the point my age do you believe jesus appears on toast this area of preparing isn t all that exciting but some things we stocked up on in the past month were tongue s tips tickling much time has passed since we began this project so we are extending the deadline to may 15 for new or updated personal impact essays poetry illustrations photographs and other creative work inspired by adam since the end of the glam nation tour december 2010 a culture dedicated to e reading will kill bookstores at the top there are small horizontal windows to look out and get a great view of st louis i ve heard people talk about the arch swaying but we did not experience that when we visited the kids were actually pretty amused at the top you are allowed to stay at the top as long as you like although it is cramped we spent 30 minutes round trip without feeling rushed and an additional 20 minutes in the free museum despite this the plot advances at a swift enough pace to not let the slightly disappointing relationship get the better of it i was happy with it as it was and i found that i wanted to keep reading before bed to find out what would happen next always a good sign though bad for my concentration levels the next day if i give in to the urge the incident was absolutely unreal the soviets cried out in terror says mr nummedal later that night he saw ambulance crews circulating in the community a driver he knew told him that they had been told to sedate everybody with a medication known to erase short term memory the soviets use this drug in the treatment of shock victims new swimsuits from aleida repertory cinemas where fellow film aficionados sit in respectful silence have been closing the foreign film section appears to be getting smaller and i do not think i have watched a movie about an artist since pollock as a fellow cinephile friend of mine often states they just don t make them anymore 10 tears and triumph this week has been a great week of seeing friends and saying good bye i was able to have lunch a few days with some amazing women the other night i went out for a girls night and i am not sure the last time i laughed so hard i will miss these people very much but i know i will make new friends plus technology makes it so easy to stay in touch this is a good exercise to practice spraying evenly close or far away and see what kinds of effects you can get since the background is mottled people won t notice if you make a mistake try close up spraying far away pushing harder pushing softer with practice you will be better able to judge how much pressure to spray with and how close to the paper you need to hold your marker i ll also cover spray patterns later this week the dress was super comfy i ve never owned a maxi dress before but i loved how comfortable it was it was so loose and long which made it very cool and breezy i think it will be very nice for the texas summer let the waves of time and space surround me let me float back to the place you found me i ll be ok of course swimming up and down the pool can get a little boring 4 the countess meets with her co writer aka writer for her book class with the countess she pontificates in what appears to be an endless way to this poor woman who is taking notes and probably wanting to stab luann in the eye instead she just nods and makes affirming noises as luann talks about kissing on both cheeks is fine because that s what i m used to that s what i like but one cheek is fine insert obvious joke about hey luann i have a cheek for you to kiss in addition to coordinating dates times and subject matter with each specific venue there are forms for parental permission a statement of purpose to be submitted to the principal for his or her approval paperwork

failure of the times public editor a position established in the wake of the jayson blair scandal to represent the readers and to champion journalistic integrity from within the paper then public editor byron calame penned two columns on the lacrosse case the first which appeared in spring 2006 minimized even the factual inaccuracies that had marred roberts early columns the second which came after the exonerations in spring 2007 denied any ideological bias to the times coverage and declined even to speculate on why the times had gotten the story so wrong for so long it was left to the ajr and the chronicle to analyze the times wreckage this outfit has been put together for a casual look but maxi skirts are perfect for evenings out and special occasions when teamed with the right shoes and accessories most stores had maxi skirts in during the spring summer season and still have them in right now in a number of materials including jersey and chiffon before purchasing them it is important to try them on because they can be quite long especially if you are petite in that case a pair of heels always comes in handy or you can have someone turn it up at the bottom i love the chiffon type material because it looks good and sleek but it can also be see through so make sure you check what it looks like on did it hurt i stuck burning hot fire on a stick in my mouth so yeah pretty much it s not like they re even making life easier or more enjoyable either i suppose yer average bread and circuses engrossed human just feels comfortable being shat on i ve finally been faced bjork we don t have internet at mom s so i m in the process of moving my pics from my old computer to the laptop so i can blog during the week when at the camper i apologize working moms stay at home moms they re both extremely hard jobs i ve fought my whole life for women to have the choices that ann romney talked about what i meant was that mitt romney is using his wife as an economic surrogate he himself said it and i just thought that that was off base but where is this money eventually ending up i do some digging in the email headers from the hijacked account and turn up an originating ip address 41 155 83 99 a quick search turns up this information looks like we re dealing with the proverbial nigerian scammers operating from somewhere near kachia nigeria we ve been having some issues lately when trying to add the disney dining plan to our existing reservation the champs is so gorge this time of year you may have an involuntary bowel movement lights are in every tree down the lane and you can smell vin chaud or mulled wine cooking a mile away a must see for sure there are loads of stands where you can buy gifts but i ve never been tempted to unfortunately the website is 1995 geocities tricked out but all the info is there i ll be talking about poetry and even reading some of my own if they can t stop me quickly enough if you re in the area next weekend friday 10th to sunday 12th june and are interested in writing there may still be day tickets available using a ladder safely so yes i am relaxed and ready for another day in crazyville that will be long thanks to conference night keep wondering that being said though i have been known to read autobiographies and do enjoy them finally there is an amazing book you can do called the artists way by julia cameron i highly recommend it it is a 12 week self lead creativity seminar in the form of a book it s brilliant you don t have to move to la to do it in fact it would be a good thing to do if you are thinking of moving to la it might give you the answers you need it was through doing the artists way that i was inspired to make my movie lollilove i completely credit this book with giving me the tools and courage i needed to complete that project a project that took over 4 years to finish and i credit lollilove with giving me the confidence and practice with the mockumentary style that lead me to landing my job on the office in the latter half of my career i have transitioned away from all the operations and management responsibilities to focus on what i love most media buying and campaign management it is far more satisfying for me than having to supervise the work of others performing the dreaded annual reviews being handed resignation letters because the employee s music career was taking off having to begin the arduous interview process or reprimanding an employee for pulling out a knife threatening a pregnant co worker thanks but no thanks all that matters is that i know i tried my best and if that isn t good enough for some people then they re just missing out can t fit chums of chance is it easier to make ends meet is it easier to sell your home or buy a new one have you saved what you needed for retirement are you making more in your job do you have a better chance to get a better job do you pay less at the pump courthouse hotel 19 21 great marlborough street london w1f 7hl i am running a half marathon this weekend and am so nervous about it that i could puke just thinking about it i looked at the route online and panicked here s to hoping i make it i mean there is a beer garden at the end so there s that to look forward to i hope i have a cheering squad aka that brian gets out of bed to encourage me and then have a beer with me after the run i trust that our mp knows what he s doing here and so would be grateful if you would support this venture as it is likely to yield dividends if it is well supported as far as i can see this declaration is very sound and says all the right things for us the ultimate question which cannot yet be answered is whether a devoutly secular society can muster the spiritual resources to fight a religious war secular culture is after all spiritually enervated and our tolerant society has allowed a popular culture to emerge which is unprecedented at least since the late roman empire in its decadence degradation and materialism when osama bin laden points his finger at this cesspool he touches a responsive chord in those of us who are opposed to him and yet recognize that something is indeed wrong you are not alone on this question we as realtors face it often this time of year with our home sellers one of the first things we tell our home sellers to do when they decide to put the house on the market is to clear away all of the clutter so are christmas decorations clutter yes and no 4 leave drugstore hair color for the ladies they seem to have better luck from to tokyo okinawa as the night wore on i suddenly felt the need to relax for a while before i head to sleep i flipped the tv on and sat back the channel was set on tv5 where a historical travel show hosted by kuya alvin abcede is airing as the show ended i changed the channel to gma7 where a teaser for the movie under viva is shown the leading man i came to realize is joseph ronald nocum and his leading lady is former survivor philippines castaway harlene san juan the film was entitled booba part 2 final answer the official soundtrack of the film was sung by richard nicdao who was discovered two years ago while singing my way in a karaoke bar the song was composed by narci del rosario and the title was ikaw ang joy ng buhay ko after the movie teaser i flipped the channel to abs cbn and found that my favorite sitcom was halfway to its end the show is starred by the popular comedy trio ralph roi romano ediemar cruz and john paulo mariano and was entitled palibhasa cute boys i began my morning show quest with the today

simple label like stirrer and do what cowards do best which by the way the stirrer thing is only cool until the end of high school the guy who talked back to the teachers and got everyone off school early he was cool but the guy who is all grown up and using his ingenuity to stir up for others because he s too scared to go out there and try to make something real of himself he s a pathetic coward greedy bankers greedy government happy thanksgiving everyone isn t he adorable there s something about neville thurlbeck that suspends all sensible judgement he needs little introduction suffice to say that once upon a time he was news editor and chief reporter of the late news of the world before hackgate blew up his award winning career to date he s been arrested twice but not charged the second time over something he wrote on his riveting blog what s rebekah brooks really like when did he lose his virginity who should play rupert murdoch in screws the musical he kindly indulged me with answers and then some if any of my followers leave me i will hunt them down like a motherfucker on the sofa she flopped good morning it s linda here it is my turn to host the challenge this week nights like tonight make me wonder how i ever pulled off a recipe like the one below something from scratch that could easily be purchased pre made in any grocery if needed to be i used to create time consuming recipes often i didn t have any excuse not to these days recipes like the one below are few and far between and if my toddler s behavior tonight wasn t a fluke then i don t see myself making much from scratch for a while rice a roni here we come here i am several years later ready to break free from this athletic slump this is really depressing and baby i know what matters the most along with luton which has a strong far right presence blackburn with darwen council has been allocated more than 200 000 to counter community divisions i am gall i am heartburn god s most deep decree for starters it s shorter and there s motion do you see the difference while i wouldn t put this in my i would read it again pile i was not disappointed with the read mr wndfl i m not a lance groupie but i admit the man fascinates me boy did i get tired of the constant lance centric tour coverage we tend to get here in the us especially in the weeks leading up to the race behold the brown faced men each group each person a picture the that s when thinking in binaries goes haywire the middle ground becomes invisible and people think say and do resoundingly stupid things because they can only see two extreme alternatives one of which is charged to the bursting point with desire food rather than nonfood or fear predator rather than nonpredator watch the way that many people on the american right these days insist that anybody to the left of george w bush is a socialist or tfor that matter the way that some people on the american left insist that anybody to the right of hillary clinton is a fascist equally and more to the point in our present context think of the way the peak oil debate was stuck for so long in a binary that insisted that the extremes of continued progress and sudden catastrophic collapse were the only possible shapes of the postpetroleum future بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم hi everyone and welcome back it is challenge time again and i thought of a really quirky crazy challenge to get your creative juices going to my grandmothers hands to have to look at this woman s face actually makes me want to throw up i m normally one to not physically get ill over pictures but good god she has been tanning her whole life her words and believe me it indeed shows she has been given a new nickname by yours truly leather head she looks nasty i m not normally one to judge people s looks and call them things but you have got to admit this is one time where there is an exception to the rule we need to keep our chins up and not let the pressures obligations and yes sacrifices of our position get us down my husband tells me all the time i am still beautiful to him even when i look like something the cat dragged in he still loves me wants me needs me and makes sure i know it little hugs here and there kisses on the cheeks and forehead telling me he loves me every day all those little things matter and how would you define excellence during your visit here

democratic fiscal irresponsibility and sound republican economic stewardship it still talks about government social programs as personally after two ultimately unsatisfying solo movies i was particularly delighted with the treatment of the hulk in this film mark ruffalo is very good as the banner incarnation of the character and when he does lose his rag and go green it s unmistakably and unashamedly the comics version of the hulk that appears he jumps around he roars he smashes things he even gets some decent dialogue i m not surprised that this film has put the possibility of another hulk movie back on marvel s agenda and after a loong day 6 hours with the handi man 3 extra hours with just chris our new front door with our old hardware was installed do you mind if i wait for the bell with you he asked me communal release so this weekend it seems like all i did was sleep read and bake cookies my friend sarah sent me a bunch of books we have very similar taste in books which is marvelous because both of us had never found anyone else that liked the kind of books we do so for the last year we ve been mailing books back and forth and trading recommendations and so i dove into a new series this weekend in between making batches of cookies tried some new cookie recipes too chocolate peanut butter chip the recipe on the bag of reese s peanut butter chips i don t like peanut butter much but lee does chocolate cherry they have m ms and maraschino cherries in them and my favorite butterscotch apple yum they even have frosting i thought about what the supper on the other side of the dining room really meant i wondered what deals were being sealed over cabernet sauvignon and sole meuniere i also thought it strange important men from two cultures both with strong and defined cuisines choosing to dine together in another totally foreign restaurant and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said is not aaron the levite thy brother i know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he shall be glad in his heart and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and i will be with thy mouth and

happy news to share in her exquisitely written fantasy debut rachel hartman creates a rich complex and utterly original world seraphina s tortuous journey to self acceptance is one readers will remember long after they ve turned the final page when i read this i sense that jeremiah didn t say it in a calm and collected manner no i should think he said it passionately showing his frustration and angst and even betraying a hint of anger in his voice perhaps the first words he muttered through gritted teeth knowing that god is righteous and good but annoyed that he was not seeing it in his life and the world around him malaysians have been punished enough for the star s oversight badu s concert was cancelled last minute and surely this had hurt the sensitivities of her thousands of fans

thousands of frankie zak s out there everyone of them with a bunch of stories just waiting to be told it just takes a little digging and you ll find it i did frankie zak was the beginning of my interest in baseball research where else would i have heard of the tarboro orioles or learned that before the orioles fielded a major league team in 1954 there was a team by the same name with a proud heritage and enough success that it could support a farm system of its own independent of the major leagues each little story unearthed every box score and faded photograph launches a million great yarns that s why frankie zak the guy from the neighborhood who never cared much for baseball is the patron saint of the infinite baseball card set meet anna kei nee anna korbinska parking costs 10 00

population report so i continue to push congressional leaders for the largest possible deal and there s going to be resistance there is frankly resistance on my side to do anything on entitlements there is strong resistance on the republican side to do anything on revenues but if each side takes a maximalist position if each side wants 100 percent of what its ideological predispositions are then we can t get anything done and i think the american people want to see something done they feel a sense of urgency both about the breakdown in our political process and also about the situation

kid gloves backing away from devastating inquiry in favor of a rather inappropriate smoothness still i come here not to bury reitman he s far from the hope for the cinema that roger ebert proclaimed him as earlier this year but he s a sincere middlebrow artisan and his failures of nerve seem borne out of deeply felt emotional generosity than calculation he managed to locate the heart beating underneath diablo cody s self consciously quirky dialogue in juno 2007 and in up in the air he brings a refreshing affection for characters like anna kendrick s hard young entrepreneur and danny

season though quite how the presence of a 30 year old forward who may well fit into barcelona s system with all the ease of zlatan ibrahimovic who along with dmytro chygrynskyi represents a rare error of judgement from guardiola would precipitate a return is puzzling then again as the premier league s player of the season barcelona must want van persie mustn t they an inability to understand that

summer that we were invited to one of jim cawley s barbeques he lived about 20 miles outside of town so it was a little bit of a drive to get to his house over dry caliches roads my dad had a little light green volkswagen beetle with no air conditioning he would always make the trips in the country fun though because when we got to the top of a hill he would always turn the engine off put the car in neutral and then coast as far as he could as the car would finally get to the point that it was about to stop he would put it back in gear pop the clutch and get the motor going again the object

the screening in the us that is customs and boarder protection which is part of the department of homeland security safety is paramount although it is probably combined with a bit of political butt

characters we identify with or are meant to identify with are we encouraged to identify with a torturer or the victim do we like the charismatic killer who dances as he slays do we care if a self centred upstart teenage twit is taught a lesson the fact is we identify with everybody people are empathetic and therefore will always place themselves in the shoes of others no matter how little sympathy they have for them and new card today that i made last night i had colored this image a week or so ago and never had the chance to put it on a card here s a person who s raised in an environment that doesn t teach them how to become a healthy human being their real needs are ignored and they develop into a fragmented non entity they don t know how to live they re too preoccupied with trying not to hurt themselves or coping with overwhelming emotional pain but make no mistake the borderline wants to feel happy and well adjusted we want to love like an adult but we re still suffering like an infant with suv s and bottled water the answer is obvious corporate interests with suv s selling high profit inefficient vehicles with bottled water selling something that 10 years ago was essentially free for those concerned with atlantic yards however the story was brodsky s ongoing and unresolved effort to assess the proper level of public investment and subsidies in such projects and the incomplete responses from government officials where all day there had been restlessness i am now there in that novel in the scene just written in the race getting ready to be underway in northern ireland in the real world which the elusive character s father was famed for winning before his death in the novel in the scene still in my head wanting my attention awareness fills me as it does with the engulfing physical and emotional presence a work in progress can have they would think where did he get his insight how did he know who is this man if they had heeded his

transfusion at the churchill tomorrow wednesday it will likely take the better part of the day me oh the padres lost too hehe but they were more interactive with the audience bad stuff conclusion it was an ok film while watching it but it was a little confusing keeping track of the many unrelated characters and we don t know what the point of it all was when done watching it simply felt completely pointless we thought it would wrap up better but then it just seemed to kinda fizzle out at the end things keep going but with a turn for the worse everyone keeps going with the shitty flow of their lives this feels like the ending of the movie wasted 2006 that we watched how bout y all what movies screwed you up as kids i have been hunting for night stands for at least 2 years it s not

it was like we had an array of addresses to visit and one of those addresses was itself an array of addresses hugs happy crafting everyone i used to love biscuits and bread and anything baked and then a little over three years ago i was diagnosed with celiac disease celiac disease is an auto immune disorder in which the body s immune system is triggered by the gluten protein more specifically a prolamine of the gluten protein called gliadin found in wheat barley rye and sometimes oats at that point i didn t know anything about alternative flours or how the heck i was going to give up my beloved bread i didn t even know much about cooking let alone baking so i starved for awhile and then i got tired of being hungry and started researching experimenting and testing when most people think about gluten free cooking they think of rice flour sorghum teff amaranth etc most folks don t think about nut flours poor almond flour is the red headed stepchild of the gluten free world i love baking with almond flour as it s high in protein and gluten and grain free plus it s so much easier to use a single ingredient than trying to whip up a gluten free baking mix from four different grain flours and various binding agents looking forward to the next perak elections means what did you catch me at i m learning to be kinder to myself in the rules and standards i ve had set up for me that i ve continued or have implemented myself i m learning that as my physical body ages it means some things take more time and changing the rules is going to become more and more necessary and that it s okay i must admit if the older boys did this at nearly 2 i would more than likely crack it sigh and tell them not to do that now many years and babies later i am more patient but more than anything i

they ll never be boney there are many different kinds of people that share the beautiful planet you live upon and each one has their own personality and character traits you have learned for the most part how to identify someone who is boisterous you can figure out someone who is withdrawn or possibly shy by simple observations the personality types are varied and complex and each one requires fluid understanding and acceptance each type has something worthwhile to contribute it is important to learn how to co relate to all people without causing harm to their emotional and mental health and you do this with the pure love that is inside your heart you act with love in all you do you not only show kindness you are kind everything you do you do with the pure purpose of loving unconditionally and accepting everyone as equal and important it is the way of god and it is your way also to act to think to feel and to be as god living purely and simply within your heart

empowering of unions is probably the most crucial and indispensable step the experience of the british labour party during the blair and brown years have shown that without counter acting the undertow

honestly haven t even attempted to build any reading stamina or do much independent reading i have several students with autism that have a very very hard time focusing and paying attention they have a hard time focusing during guided reading and direct instruction i m spending a lot of time redirecting and prompting them to stay on task even when we re at the small group table and i can t imagine them being able to focus enough for independent reading i guess i ve been afraid that it would be an impossibility for these students does anyone have any advice or suggestions should i try it anyway if you have any tips for helping keep these students on task or focused i would greatly appreciate it clearly derek clark is not just a corrupt disloyal odious and cowardly waste of money but it seems

talk to you next week the type of history i refer to is seldom found in textbooks and yet it is very much part of the canadian experience i call it pioneer social history because it deals with the lives and times of ordinary citizens however since these stories usually went to the grave with them it is necessary to reconstruct their lives from journals and fist hand accounts sunday leftovers don t remember what they were exactly i might just go plea if you have any questions please contact inac directly as they would have the official information that relates to your specific individual situation we put the kids in the y s childcare for a bit so we could exercise for real i headed for the elliptical machines the cool ones with tvs attached to them everyone around me watched news or sports but i threw caution to the wind let them judge me and watched the golden girls it was the episode where dorothy sleeps with her ex husband stan and then considers getting back together with him don t do it dorothy i cried he cheated on you with that bimbo krissy remember the guy next to me startled a bit when i laughed out loud but i couldn t help myself that sophia is such a pistol 3

pr said well if you want a on the show it would be nice if you could also put x on the show now now for those of you who might happen to be vegan don t take offense to this i don t think like this now and to be fair i was brainwashed by the donkey i mean i grew up partially on a studding farm full of cows and one donkey a studding farm for those of you who ve never been near a farm means that our farm existed for the explicit purpose to breed cows so you all could eat it why a donkey on that kind of farm you know i have no idea but i m quite sure he snuk into my room while i was sleeping and brainwashed me he was smart enough to do it too whenever you d holler hey sporty show me your pearly whites he d roll up his top lip and show you his teeth he was a genius donkey i m telling you d i learned too about the growing habits of certain vegetables and how to manage them so you don t end up with vegetables and vines growing totally out of control of course it s the far left version i m obsessed with view b the black sort of sack dress that is the quintessence of hefty bag hauteur of course the first thing it made me think of was this quick name that i love lucy episode pour the whole thing to a baking tray cover it with foil and put it inside the oven for two to four hours keep checking at intervals because it matters because you matter because we are all enough i was sleeping ohh that was just a dream tomorrow morning at cod crack o dawn i take off for my annual trip i will be shooting with nine models in ten days three of those day will be spent with my chicago model while we go to the kinsey show and then head to the canyons for some nude in landscape work in the evenings we will work in the hotel rooms when my daughter was a pre schooler we loved sesame street and anything having to do with big bird i m not for sure who enjoyed the show more one of our favorite movies was big bird goes to china there was a song from the movie that has stuck with me through the years i ve been singing it all week i hope i have all the spellings correct and i m sorry i am not able to show all the accent marks above the letters i am sure they are in my computer somewhere this blush is gorgeous i reach for this when i don t want to look like i m wearing a lot of makeup but i still want a glow its a very muted coral though and doesn t have any shimmer i love it though my go to blush for summer and without exaggeration i stood completely still for several moments mouth open and everything flabbergasted by her self absorption still not quite over the ridiculous comment i explained that grand ma s dying husband situation was a bit different than anne s situation at which point she further underscored her mind numbing selfishness by screaming so what you can take my word for it that for men like me a marriage after the type of goethe s would be the best of all that is to say a marriage with a good housekeeper but even this idea is repellent to me a young and cheerful daughter to whom i would be an object of reverence would be much more to the point 6 have outlined the sentiment with copic c1 and lightly touched music with copic e11 added clear glitter this is one of those cards that s so much prettier in your hands i cant get shiny pics photographed well i dedicate this post to rebecca dickinson who nominated me for the kreativ blogger award please visit her blog a word or more here as soon as we arrived i was overwhelmed with my nani mummy s mother and dadi s dad s mother cheek pinches warm hugs and delicious indian foods and while i seemed to be drowning in all of this affection before i knew it mummy was in the hospital today i understand that my sister was born a full month prematurely as there were problems concerning mummy s glucose level due to the gestational diabetes anyway i m going to refrain getting all medical y in this post since it s about something entirely different but i vaguely remember not being allowed to visit mummy for two days because she was very very sick those two days were miserable suddenly all the hype about meeting my baby sister was overshadowed by my mother being in critical condition in addition to the temper tantrums rejection of food and breaking out of stress hives apparently i had developed a great angst for nimisha who was not the healthiest baby at the time i blamed mummy s being ill on my sugar high sister kind of deep for a five year old no i tend to think so but apparently that s what happened happy 4th of july everyone almost all of the clips of lee brilleaux talking in oil city confidential were taken from an interview filmed in the back bar of the grand in the early 1990s you can just see the front bar behind him the whole 50 minute interview is also on the dvd as an extra finally there are the additions to etc asterisk extensions_custom conf we will need to add at least two contexts to that file the first handles inbound calls from google voice you only need one of these no matter how many google voice users you have but you have a choice between two contexts remember that at the start of this article i said you had to decide whether you want to answer the call as soon as it comes into your system or defer answering until a destination extension picks up well if you decided to let asterisk answer the call as soon at it arrives then you ll need to add this context the lettermen i don t always cry i realize my list is a little more focused on the female population of the world but if you are a male and want to dive into this challenge there are lots of possibilities for you too some of these things like photography technology self publishing are for either gender and you could add things like preaching construction whatever your little heart desires hey you could research knitting if you wanted i won t tell i had been waiting for the right time to try the last of my christmas winter seasonal beers santa s butt was a christmas present from thad and ended up being a pretty nice present every person deserves your love and attention i was one of those students who did well on tests apparently i had a good short term memory even for facts i didn t care about and i did care about grades that combination made me a strong student but now in my post school life it looks more like a weakness then a strength it is a weakness being afraid to admit to not knowing something i hate it when i don t know an answer or when people are talking about something i have never heard of i expect myself to know everything because in the world of school i don t know means you fail and i almost never failed the few times i did it was not acceptable now i have to remind myself that it s ok not to know things i have had to practice saying i don t know perhaps unwittingly downfall seems to confirm suggestions made by the defence during the perjury trial ssp witnesses were not just testifying to what they claimed was true but that they were actively seeking to have sheridan convicted daniel he s like the best dad ever my life won t be this full always though i wish i had more of these wonderful balancing moments in my life now i am also aware that our homeschooling and family lifestyle changes with the seasons there may even be one day when my life feels off kilter the other way and i long for some of the fullness and noise of my current experience but for now i am so thankful for this wonderful afternoon and this week of restoring balance i love books i love everything about them their smell the pages the ink the glue used in the binding and most of all i love the story so neatly contained within those pages waiting to take me away if i know a movie is based off a book i always want to read the book first after the tremendous success of psycho in 1960 this was the most popular alfred hitchcock film ever at the box office the director turned his attention to an equally shocking story the birds in 1963 while some critics were openly disappointed with this work the birds shows hitchcock at the power of his storytelling genius and remains in my mind one of the top ten films he ever made out of all the categories that comprise serious violence which the british crime survey considers in its report domestic violence has the highest percentage 45 of repeat victimisation and repeat victimisation accounts for 73 of all incidents of domestic violence in the majority of incidents of domestic violence the victims were women i e 85 individual art has the ability to evoke special feelings inside of an individual the fact that art makes people feel special is undeniable and relates directly to every human s need to embellish decorate and personalize writes cathy malchiodi in her recent blog post what is art for the restoring power of imagination she explains how important art is to an individual because of our unique taste for aesthetically pleasing design and appealing imagery i asked him about his writerly fascination with sex sex fuentes said as anything else in life is an avenue to literature without literature it would have no meaning i am a literary animal for me everything ends in literature i was not overly impressed with what i saw in this particular set of photos however there were a few pieces that stuck out worse than others but thank goodness for the awesome southwest airlines which provides comfy leather chairs with plugs and for logan airport which has free wi fi it s hidden on their site but all you need to do is watch a short commercial and i have a bagel with cream cheese life is tolerable again in other news i submitted my proposal to teach a continuing education reading course over the summer and i think i am going to apply to be a mentor teacher next year hopefully i ll be chosen i think it will be a very positive experience if i get it i have to admit that i m really bad with holidays mainly holidays that we don t celebrate back home i just don t memorise these dates and i know they are coming only when i get an invitation to go to my kids school for celebration with mother s day this year happened the same thing at least the 1989 iteration gave me a great stage memory i tended to lose myself to the performance i would gather up all the angst and frustration i had built up over the last chunk of time at school work and elsewhere and blast all of it out of me in a pique of adrenaline i m pretty sure i bled at every turdburglars or forestoryforehead gig usually a skinned knee from an ill advised jump but on a not infrequent basis i d bloody up my pug by crashing headlong into people i m surprised i don t have a permanent mic grille print on my face the big news is her kitchen is about ready for a semi reveal of freshly painted nigerian units were not deactivated someone who is apparently a vicious bully and a tyrant someone who applies no scientology in his daily life someone who has avoided any real training and processing for the last 15 years is in charge of bringing scientology to the planet the hot pink may be a bit much for some of us but i love because even though i ve been where she is in some ways in many others i will never know where she is the explosive nature of losing a child of burying a child of not ever hearing their name called out loud in the playground or the supermarket breaks each mother differently and then it re forms us and even if the world never sees the child we bore they do see the resulting mother and that mother is forever transformed if you re familiar with the usual steps of the traditional publishing process you know that novels go through several rounds of edits and then they are typeset into galleys the second movement had none of the lilt which might have been expected from this orchestra but rather a natural flowing line with shaping more pronounced than pulse i feared for a moment at the beginning of the third movement as the firsts were scrappy and more than a little behind my thoughts oh schlamperei please don t intrude now though when i saw nézet séguin s minuscule beat i could see what the problem was in any case things soon got onto a steadier footing and nézet séguin wound a very tight coil with the tension released only at the very last minute in a glorious brass blaze of the sort that normally gets a raucous ovation though never in a philharmoniker concert there should perhaps be something unheimlich and indistinctly menacing about this neglected by yn s and the philis though the hollowness of the triumph soon struck home in their final movement torment and despair registered as they must but never in a way which made me want to reach for the nearest mariss jansons recording as in the first movement d major heralded something new with real breadth i often find performances of this final movement lacking in length or at least a sense of it and gave the minor something of import to extinguish how much this all had to do with nézet séguin ron paul 2012 we were almost getting flak for tweeting on work time shearing says a few months later she received a growing audience

and i understand that high quality ingredients come with a higher price tag but for me the price isn t something that would fit into my regular budget if it fits into yours all the more power to you i think that some of these products mainly the gel the bars and the protein powder would be worth buying if financially feasible it must have been love declaration of war against all working and upstanding people 1 son spent 6 hours in the kitchen 3 jem and the holograms now this was one of my favorites and i clearly remember on my first day of kindergarten we were asked to sing the theme song from our favourite show i belted out jem jem is truly outrageous truly truly truly outrageous woo ooo jem jem the music s contagious i even remember getting jem blue and pink eye shadow and

try to go to work a bit earlier just to talk about this we compare observations and speculations etc amazing right he s awesome seriously how many of you can actually say that you boss is as cool as mine staggering home no doubt feeling the adverse effects of the wine and the yogurt alex suddenly realizes that he has misplaced his keys luckily nicole is waiting in the hall to help him out beckoning him to her apartment alex approaches her door as if he were in a trance the jagged chunks of wood the covered all the passage ways inside her apartment created this cool vaginal effect once in the apartment nicole says i turn you on don t i i m not sure he had much time to answer because before you know it nicole is unmooring her aforementioned tight black panties i knew they d be black and i knew they d be tight in a highly unique manner she pulls them out through a slit in the side of her skirt and preparing to plant herself on top of his probably erect penis the bad news is that we have not seen any evidence of the rat meaning he may have hidden himself in the water room and died in there i suppose another few days and we will know for sure which it is and here is todays

holmes simple suppers chicken n noodles fixins were at work grandpa would spend his time in the park walking watching the children play and realistic tao the fierce and strong characteristics that people who practice martial arts tend to have are not found anywhere on tao this doesn t mean that he s not mature or serious enough but towards a young 93 liner brother who is always protected by his older brothers this all is just a bit early but because of this he has the child like personality of speaking exactly what he thinks the first time he was asked about his ideal type he avoided the question the second however he expressed after thinking that this question would be asked again i went home to properly think about it i like with this sort of realistic answer laughing to tears is unavoidable when patrick contacted me about taking him and his wife rachel on a 3 day backpacking trip i was excited but concerned did she know what she was getting into both were quite fit and competed in marathons and iron man competitions so that eased my fears some it ended up that they were prefect clients i gave them a list of gear that they should have proper clothing etc they prepared i let them know that they needed to try and hike a bit before heading out on this trip they prepared i followed up with them a few days before and advised that we would have some rain they prepared i could not have asked for better clients for this trip when you have all edges zigzagged you want to fold your square in half wrong sides together and with a very narrow hem sew a straight stitch down the two side edges leave the top edge open or it won t be a pouch the bottom fold will be the bottom of your pouch do a zigzag stitch down both newly sewn sides i thought it would be nice to have all of my seams on the outside to add a little character so the wrong side should be on the outside of your pouch and the nicely finished side should be on the inside the old man drew close and opened the box two metal gauntlets lay inside at first coals excitement sank they d be worth something but not for the risks he d taken looking closer he noticed their difference they were silver a lace of intricate patterns they weren t large or bulky like soldier s gauntlets they were more like gloves the metal so thin and the fingers there were gaps between the metal on the fingers delicately linked like a spider s web allowing the wearer to move their hands like normal coal picked them up without invitation and put them on strangely on the palm was a clear circle of glass held by more metal attached to the rest of the gauntlet entranced by their beauty he didn t hear what the old man was babbling about my new boyfriend wanted to learn to ride and we let him try amalia she was at her best behavior and so charming that she could have melted anyone s heart she did not get sold that day my boyfriend did once again amalia had chosen her rider holy time yes locke why did charles bring you back to the island i will be updating soon with new work in progress photos of my painting some newly released images from my 1st earth goddess body art photoshoot the drug scenes are absolutely hilarious creating comedy gold in the form of hill and tatum tripping on the same synthetic drugs that they are trying to stop the moment where tatum bursts through the band room doors and trips over a bell set then eventually catapulting through a gong brings me to tears every time hill dancing on the track being commended by riggle is also comedy gold eventually leading to the baton penis that again probably makes the female crowd shake their un approving heads they believe they will attain perfection on earth greying ghost press 48 our message to lake and the edl leaders

star of david says it all at the very least conduct surveys to find out what they would consider quality or excellence in doing business with you you might also wish to consult some of them about your procedures and products this reinforces their relationship with the company and encourages future sales i have slowly come to appreciate this and am learning how feel the same sense of accomplishment from successfully executing a passport photo as i got from seeing pip and polly s first steps in the grand scheme of things i think i had much more to do with the former than i did with the latter this guy sure loves to dance frogs seem to be all legs and are excellent jumpers i love their bulgey eyes she became attached to my hip especially since we moved to jakarta it s normal because she s in a new environment and have spent a lot of time with me alone as i don t know many people who have kids of her age i drag her everywhere when i have errands now i have two days with 4 hours in the morning when she s going to be in school and it makes me feel better to do stuff that doesn t cater to her needs and i can do that without feeling guilty it s for younger readers how young i can t say but young enough that i couldn t really get past all the boys a lot of the ya i read when i actually was one was chick lit because i was always looking for someone to relate to over the years i have grown out of that but with this a little part of my 14 year old self came back i didn t save the atom station for last because i thought it would be my favorite laxness but i enjoyed reading it very much and liked it more than i had expected for one thing the title put me off with apologies to my nuclear scientist friend reed i thought that the novel might be more about communism or socialism than about human nature or love what was i thinking laxness always writes about human nature and love the signs are not terribly encouraging the central bank governor riad salameh cut short an interview when asked about the aftermath of the american action calling it an old story as for those nearly 200 suspect accounts mr salameh would only say that he does not involve himself in such commercial questions 1 fugazi blueprint we don t care about his race she said we consider him one of us to top it up all i am grateful to all my family and friends for the great reception i have no idea why either it felt so real i want to go back there i want to see more i want to talk with her again and see that place again i can still feel her hand on my shoulder as we floated over the valley i can still see her eyes as she spoke the words your mind is capable of so much more than you know she always had this certain look about her whenever she was about to tell me something really important and that was the look she had in the dream what was she about to say what was she trying to tell me was it really just a dream i ll write more soon i drank it so fast why the crowning pushing stage were so painful for me now i did have an easy birth and the pain of crowning and pushing was actually about what i had expected it would be but now seeing what was actually happening in my vagina when i birthed this baby it kinda makes me wonder if the next one will be a totally crazy pain free birth or something i can t imagine how much easier it would be to push out only a head a head is already shaped to fit through the opening provided for the baby an arm shoulder head is not smooth and round tyler come on now i m done non metal post and a quickie here s a single promo track from greece s lamentation which was later renamed nachtkaiser and featured der stürmer personnel this track was also released later under nachtkaiser monicker on a compilation tape which i haven t heard so i don t know if it s the same recording or different somehow anyways this one i got from my trader around 1997 i think i also do not ask unreasonable prices for performances and merchandise with where i m at in my career at the same time i try not to get ripped off my plan to remedy that exactly what are those markings now my conjecture is that a knock on the door interrupts her thoughts and causes the intern to jump away and run to answer it dog can send you barking mad it s definitely a very different experience to the whole nanowrimo thing it takes so few words to make the daily page count that actually it s a lot easier well apart from one thing in both of these writing adventures quality is not important that s fine with nano it s quite liberating to be spaffing out 1700 words in a day with no thought to the standard reading over it is painful but you know why it s that bad so it s fine when you re unsure if the word is pitchers or pictures just combine the two to cover all bases the news of the world has at last won its vendetta against a left wing politician it has done so with the connivance of the lord advocate if at first you don t succeed keep trying scottish justice has notched up another political miscarriage of justice alongside that of al megrahi and muir of huntershill hi i am nina may and i am the owner and also the illustrator for all the

the bu blog to publish exclusive writings not published anywhere else and barbados underground frequently repeats mr henry s barbados advocate newspaper columns in full without copyright problems from

didn t like the pacific point and the purple together but did like the two blues and the white just didn t fit in anywhere being color challenged do you see my dilemma i really like how this card came out and am quite satisfied with my color arrangement holy metal batman i have packages and that s not good 2048 e x 22 1994 reviewing a review of the merchant of venice chicago tribune sec 1 p 26 see

treasure mostly being rocks and cheerios no walker bahrain pearl square sometimes a reader can know too much especially when it comes to reading alt histories or alt realities this was certainly the case for me in reading the dragon waiting although ford is not a poor prose writer there really is not anything spectacular about his writing he describes events in a workman like fashion and the plot pieces just fall one two three finis the slightly altered historical personages and ford s invented protagonists do not mesh well together and there is nothing convincing about the dialogue that takes place although the question of the dragon may be of interest to some readers it failed to have much of an impact with me i found it odd that the one creative act that no man could ever do was put down and written about in disgusting terms by feminist writers such as simone de beauvoir and shulamith firestone who gained far more attention from other feminists than those writers such as barbara katz rothman and gena corea who wrote cogently and intelligently about birth issues i think this led de beauvoir and firestone among others into philosophical nonsense that led to a great deal of confusion and poor policy this is probably one big reason that we have one size fits all birth care policy and virtually no regulation of assisted reproductive technologies in the us no laws no rules against the implantation of multiple embryos even though these involve great risks to the health of the mother curve readers what works for you share your tried and true technique or tip in a comment or via

passed him the name of mr whittamore but denied that it was andy coulson as he was not at the now at the time and that it probably wasn t greg miskiw either mr sheridan finally asked what the witness

likely to make a poor food choice opting for something salty or sugary instead of anything remotely healthy for me and it seems every time i opt for a bad snack at 3 i let the rest of the day slide and have a not so great dinner followed by a very bad dessert i m an all or nothing kinda gal and though i know i shouldn t when i screw up and eat something i shouldn t the flood gates open and i find myself eating whatever i want for the rest of the day now that i recognize that my 3pm munchies are the cause of many of my falls off the wagon i am making a concerted effort to prepare and snack wisely i always have carrot sticks hummus or white bean spread for example but for some reason i still automatically gravitate towards salt laden crackers that i can t stop myself from buying a different brand is on sale each week it s not my fault so clearly i need something salty and crispy and easy to grab like crackers enter the kale chip delicious nutritious salty and easy to grab i

ben shows up for war horse s date in gloves and a heavy coat and she shows up in a sweater people from arizona slash california are such pussies about cold weather so am i i got cold in hawaii once but in fairness i had built and ice luge in my shower and was pouring booze down it while my masseuse was holding my feet in the air and my wife was spraying me with that aerosol evian water stuff my honeymoon was great they d never let a man like me in a slutensuite any suite i am in becomes the fantasy suite my big worry is that when the reno s are done the owner will up the rent it s entirely possible i mean why else would an owner update a unit technically the house is for sale so maybe it s only for upping the sale value but we will see i don t think we can live here if the rent goes up so maybe eventually we will have to find somewhere new too but i think i will worry about that when it comes he s planning on doing these renovations over the next year that s a lot of time and god knows the future better than i and he takes care of us a couple of these stone arabia and pulphead are nominated for this year s national book critics circle award the reading is this march to which i will happily drag cityboy and afterwards enjoy a delicious dinner at da andrea if i get my druthers i don t know why i didn t pay attention to this movie back in the 90 s might have been that i was getting fired right around its release then again that might have caused me to miss a movie in 91 99 04 etc regardless for those in philly irregardless it was a fun story that featured dialogue almost as witty as when harry met sally and almost as scenic as dude where s my car add to that a fabulous shot of abe vigoda in a headdress and grass skirt and you can t lose end paul also was a jew and

focused on the subject my victories in ireland pale against coming to christ but the many things i was able to see and experience offered me a number of reasons to celebrate as mentioned in a previous post visiting ireland has been a nearly lifelong dream so just being there was pretty darn amazing beyond the landscapes castles and all the other things a person normally would expect to find there some of the best things were not really anticipated the interpretation given to mr yates was that an offence could only be proved to have been committed where it could be proved beyond reasonable doubt that a message on a mobile phone had been accessed by a third party before the intended recipient had heard it on the guidance mr yates stated he had been given it was necessary to prove that messages were hacked before the recipient got to them understandably that would be something very difficult to prove to the right is an activity i like to do each year each child is given fruit loops to create a pattern of choice they glue them on then label their pattern by color number and letter they always like this activity because they get to each the leftover cereal i thought i guess i could combine all of these into one and just make it kind of one random blog separate from this 365 days to live my best life blog but all encompassing on anything else in the world i feel like getting off my chest but really who has the time for that i m hardly organized enough to remember my 2 different email accounts let alone manage 2 different blogs i haven t even figured out what i need to know about blogging yet anyway so i m probably not the best person to start branching out summarize information better yet roast your own this process is incredibly easy and will produce a very tasty treat without any extra fat additives or preservatives you can enjoy nuts this way or blend them up to make the nut butter of your dreams get creative combine two or more of your favorite roasted nuts and seeds to make delicious nut butter blends like sesame cashew pecan pumpkin or almond hazelnut sunflower just make sure to roast the nuts and seeds separately as they require different roasting times respectively this is a stark contrast from what i have observed in france meaning the french are quite normal and make an effort to limit each festivity within their designated months and i must admit that i quite prefer the french way of commercialism it s less annoying things began to change in the spring of 1984 as i thought about teaching the vietnam war one more time i kept coming back to two things my desire to show the impact of the war on those who did not fight in it and the title of george herring s book vietnam was america s longest war and we had been involved in it in one way or another for twenty five years i jotted down a series of key dates in the vietnam conflict from 1950 the tentative beginnings of our involvement there through may 1975 when saigon fell to the north vietnamese next to each date i briefly noted how old i was at the time what i was doing and where possible how a particular event affected me this filled only half a page but the exercise both personalized the war for me and opened an avenue to explore in a small way the domestic impact of vietnam what i had produced was the sketchy odyssey of a kid from the lower middle class growing up during america s longest war that s it for tonight have a great weekend my friends we went out to eat after but i had totally lost my appetite in the excitement and could hardly eat a thing i seemed to have no problem with the champagne though now flip it as mentioned the padres have been in petco park since 2004 not that long a time but in that time they have won a cy young jake peavy they almost won another trevor hoffman barely finished second one year and mat latos received some cy young consideration as a 22 year old the rangers meanwhile have never won a cy young award and

and please do not forget to leave the design team ladies some loving comments on their work meanwhile the 50th annual bc human resources management association conference tradeshow is taking place at our popular new vancouver convention centre where seemingly somewhat unconventional canada s comedian rick mercer s resourcefulness will no doubt have delegates laughing but the biggest problem is that everyone plausibly acts and re acts as if this were a western with giant bunnies stepping in for black bart and his mangy gang of outlaws tearing through the one horse town eating people to be perfectly honest there is not one moment of this thing that can be taken seriously as a horror movie an ecological message movie or even a movie movie for that matter if it hadn t been for the child then none of this might have happened but the fact that a child was involved made everything that much harder to forgive not that there is anything to forgive of course but the fact that a child was mixed up in it all made us feel that there was no going back that it mattered the fact that a child was affected meant we had to face ourselves properly we had to follow through now when i crave the nicotine rush the yellow tinge to my fingers the smoky smell of burnt tobacco those once fleeting moments of intellectual competence i chew my drugged up chicklet bemoan my fate and blame everyone else finally we decided the woman pertains to the city and the son to the temple the temple gets destroyed ezra s eschatological promise is for the restoration of both as zion is a wasteland without

celebrate anything that is traditionally being celebrated with that being said last week was my birthday april 27th and with the opening sentence you should already know that i treated the day as business as usual day the hotel itself is really impressive with a central hallway that runs the entire length of the hotel 1 mollusc gives me d t s and da willies i would have liked to say this was

you are a japanese teenage girl with your legs cut off by a vampire and somehow through the genius of your father the vice principal your severed legs are mounted to the vertex of your skull where they spin like helicopter blades to propel you through space over the campus on the other hand there are several of their beers that leave me cold the leinenkugel s original is unpleasant to me strangely this is the beer that they used to establish themselves but i find it over hopped and a little strange the berry weiss is basically a chick beer lotsa berry and only sorta kinda beery and

it he tries so hard to be normal and act like the other children when he is at preschool but it exhausts him when he gets home this was a hard calling to accept it was one that i begged god not to make me do home school this child the one that i have been counting the years until he went to kindergarten but i couldn t deny the overwhelming peace this decision brought i guess god gives you that

people drink drinks that have pretty colours and fruity flavours like soft drinks but are about 6 alcohol or pretty pleasant tasting cocktails at the same time the hypnotic music pounds away disorientating them there are often tv screens all around showing sport pop acts or models on catwalks this bar had a couple of bouncy castles upon which customers bounced gleefully mindless that outside their bubbles of pleasure there is a dangerous hostile world recent bomb attacks were outside london nightclubs a cool bar is unreal and like being in a dream there is also the use of the hallucinatory effects of drugs in adverts i saw an advert for vodka shots which was a square of undulating shades of blue light you do not see these colours by drinking vodka gulps of air or not you see this by taking ecstasy and finally my favorite group on royal i don t know if it s because of the singer s personality or because of the tourists dancing in the street or because of the excellence in music all three really i honestly believe that while watching this series i began to actually over think things i was left with thoughts of just to whom the show was marketed it is so obviously a show for young adults most of the main characters are in high school a lot of the action revolves around the school and many of the themes relate to teenage life and feelings something fun to share

remover brightener in one now we might specify that defeat of a bill in the second chamber never constitutes a loss of confidence in the government so that it does not trigger resignation or dissolution but then we need a mechanism other than an election for getting over the conflict between the two chambers at least for those bills that need to be passed such as budgets how this is to be done is not obvious though not impossible but whatever mechanism is its existence dilutes the power of the second chamber to reject the government s proposals and thus diminishes the benefits waldron hopes for it first of all i got my main materials together the other thing that could have been said of course is that arianism is alive and well today the so called jehovah s witnesses the truth of course is that i m probably in an unfortunate minority the chances are that most women in that room are being treated for a primary cancer that s perfectly manageable and so feeling daft about having a decidedly less hardcore treatment for a decidedly more hardcore cancer is about as dumb as it gets it s not like you can advertise that stuff though i mean it s just not the done thing to loudly wax lyrical about your diagnosis in such a scenario and i haven t yet been given a special membership badge that ll explain away my presence plus i can t really meet every what the are you doing here look with my secondary sob story it s not fair on anyone concerned and besides it d make me and my ipad look decidedly less flash however it s my blog birthday yes i know i know have just bored the

s all to do with something called alpha waves this isn t the place for a detailed examination of the theory and if it were i m not the person to do it it s controversial of course but seems to be backed up by some scientific research it really did seem like i had no time to myself ok more accurately no time to craft but lots of other fun was had so i shouldn t complain too much teehee before kickoff they were 5 points behind the red owners the message was clear anything other than 3 points would have been regarded as sheer disappointment such a bright line rule pit bulls are per se dangerous is misguided don t get me wrong i in no way condone what happened in this case the dog was left in a small pen escaped and attacked and seriously injured a child the owner put the dog back in the same pen and the dog escaped yet again and mauled another child causing life threatening injuries note do not fool with it no attempt at kneading just mix put it is the baking dish and in the

can help him been pointed out to us and we noticed it too that there are still some corners of the sciences typically those where there isn t much money in play that are open to participation by amateurs there are also quite a few branches of scientific work that are scarcely being done at all these days again because there isn t much money in play and their number is likely to increase as funding cuts continue to my mind one of the places where these trends intersect with the needs of the future is in local natural history and ecology the kind of close study of nature s patterns that launched the environmental sciences back in the day to cite an example very nearly at random it would take little more than a microscope a notebook and a camera to do some very precise studies of the effect of organic gardening methods on soil microorganisms beneficial and harmful insects and crop yields or to settle once and for all the much debated question of whether adding biochar to garden soil has any benefits in temperate climates nooooooo idiot nooooooo i love hearing my phone chirp letting me know that a special someone is trying to chat with me on gmail first smile caught on camera

lately i thought i wouldn t get any dew i had asked for rain at the spring equinox and since we re in a drought condition it s good to have it the snack selection ranges from flapjacks to natural nuts and seeds to dried fruits to mini cakes and tea to deli breads and chutneys so far my rave range has to be the little dessert type punnets they include for example jaffa cake lemon meringue pie raspberry cheesecake the list goes on you get the taste of your most loved desserts but made with whole foods and without the calorie laden cost see lemon meringue below who knew it was because of an

your body is currently able to simply because what is going to happen is that overtraining and straining the body can cause it to hurt all over and these aches and pains will dissuade you from following your training day after day it s actually an easy task to move from couch to 5k all you should do when you re starting your 5k training if you ve by no means trained before is to take every single day by itself just focus on what you want to do on a certain day and don t attempt to do less or more than that now the key to practicing for 5k for those who have had no previous training is to alternate between walking and running in case you run a little distance and then when you can t run any more walk a little distance until you ensure you get your wind back then run again you ll discover that you can cover a great deal more ground than you would if you run without stopping yes that s all it takes to go from couch to 5k cd if there was one thing you d change about yourself

vitality for it came of winter s giving ground as though making a crucial concession in an argument the earth begins to lose its rigidity like a set mind realizing that its way of imagining the world while not wholly false has been too limited winter is not the whole story to a mind thus restricted the disturbing experience of doubt turns out to be a blessing since it opens the way not to chaos and meaninglessness but to mother wit a perceptiveness that is older more expansive shrewder more weathered more generous and now i m back again either way though my academic engine has difficulty shutting off and so here i am with some meta notes my own attempt to try to understand precisely the formula that makes something like this so addicting and even interesting i trust myself to do what is in my best interest what a week and what a month if you have ever traded in your life or been an entrepreneur you know the stress that comes along with periods where sales are down or in my case trades are just not working out in your favor the past month has been one of those months where nothing just seems to work this started april 3 rd when i was working with a client in a live shadow trading session i had been calling for a sharp gold sell off for the past week and mentioned that same morning it was about to happen here pretty quickly later in that day or the next now i have been working a euro asian session the past 3 months at an fx firm so my days have been 17 hours and on this day i wanted to take an hour nap to before coming back to trade the afternoon session well i came back to gold down more than 50 points which was huge money in the gld puts huge these are the trades where you make your 10 15k in a few minutes that make up for the small losers you take here and there any trader can tell you that it s the winners that make the small losers feel like they never existed and the big trades are absolutely necessary for survival in this game from that point on i missed a few big moves in priceline last week and then again this wednesday after putting a strong short position on apple looking for sub 580 that position flipped on me and i was stopped only to see the move come today and watch the same contracts trade to 7 00 which would have netted me north of 9 000 this type of thing will happen and all we can do is continue to move forward others won t understand it and why should they this is a game only a few have the nerves or courage to attempt and even fewer who actually succeed but it s the idea of mastering it if that is possible that keeps me motivated that keeps me pushing to better myself as a trader and it should do the same for those of you who are serious about it this business will make you self reflect like none other guaranteed and when you miss on trades or lose on trades that seems to be multiplied but the key so i believe is to keep on pushing i mean where else are you able to make this type of money and feel such reward

an english baptist who lived in peru between 1903 and 1952 shortly after arriving in peru in 1903 payne was living on a missionary farm near cuzco where one day he met an american gold mine prospector called franklin who told him that whilst travelling down an old inca road he spotted some old ruins at the top of a nearby mountain but hadn t had time to explore them payne was too busy to follow this information up at the time but three years later stuart mcnairn a scottish presbyterian came to live at the farm and payne asked him if he wished to join him on an expedition to the ruins they

ideas into action and therefore deliver innovation not just creative ideas i have facilitated so many workshops that have ended with enthusiasm and buy in to the ideas that have emerged yet three six nine months down the line hardly any progress has been made continuing a schedule started in 1966 of touring the united states exactly every three years the stones played in a mixture of theatres sometimes under a pseudonym arenas and stadiums a practice that they would follow for many of their future tours as well the tour was the first in which charlie watts used the famous gretch drum set that he continues to play with the stones to this day as well as his first employment of a china cymbal as a crash and dropping the downbeat out of his hi hat playing when hitting the snare drum two unique techniques that he continues to employ today the concerts featured backing vocals by ronnie wood and keith richards something that the stones would get away from beginning with their next tour

rake is believed to be a shortened form of rakehell derived from the middle english rakel rakel has connotations of wanderlust and rash decision making the rake is typically a womanizer a gambler and a duelist occasionally he s a poet he can range from a dastardly libertine who get girls pregnant and leaves them to poverty and social exile to the genteel highwayman stealing from the rich to give

and low levels of fitness and healthy eating i came back to this mat now awakened by that week it was merely a week to pass through amidst a month requiring only continued breath to survive funny i made so many other demands upon myself while there according to a gainesville police department arrest report the man saw his stolen property in the driveway at 6506 nw 33rd terrace para contains three loosely connected moments all held in a sort of arrest the first moment is a man brooding at a keyboard who decides to swivel out of his chair presumably to play his horn his chair is perched on some sort of disgusting blob and he languishes out of it without noticing the patch of luminosity above the piano keys the man s motion leads him down a long thick curtain where we find a couple revealed by passage of cloth pulled back the male part of the couple is ready to enter what might be a room hidden behind the curtain and he tries to pull his limp reticent female counterpart into the space not only does she not want to go but she has no interest in carrying her cello which she allows to fall towards the floor the last moment of the work is a still life to the right of the man and

money usually there is more than one reason and their lives surely to get to such a desperate level in much more disarray than my own periodically clouded judgment i flew from the u k via amsterdam whereas the lady i was going to see has always flown via manchester the manchester route requires a train ride across the pennines and it requires also a longish stopover in atlanta the trip to my

area and an in airport branch of the rijksmuseum full of old master paintings this week i am also definitely planning to make some caramel syrup for coffees i did make some pumpkin spice latte syrup a

diaries were boring and void one could never get any good sense of the 18 year old who wrote them i had almost forgotten about the stuff until a co worker who is participating in a weight loss competition mentioned that the product was suggested by his nutritionist i had just happened to have a 35 amazon gift card from crowdtap that was burning a hole in my email so i decided to take the plunge and try it i wasn t really sure what to do on the top i didn t really feel like a cake topper would look right but then i had the genius idea of adding her favourite chocolates ferrero rocher i did initially want to pile them up like in the advert but it looked a bit silly so i thought just to dot a few around symmetrically and do some more polka dot piping in a circle around the top of the

about becoming either men or women a case in point is the insistence on the part of quite a few moms that their sons pee sitting i am grateful for a spoonful of fierceness as required i was furious

that used to be a part of mine the last garden on the tour and well worth the wait this garden felt big and small at the same time lots of large trees and old growth really made you realize that you were in the middle of a big old forest there were vegetables worked into the borders and lots of volume to the plantings beautiful structures everywhere went well with the large trees giving some size to the garden which couldn t be achieved with plants alone this garden had tons of flowers but they weren t the predominant sight by any means there were tons of big ferns beautiful moss and lots of leaf color and pattern it was very peaceful here the little girl began to get a little frustrated with the whole idea but a few days later decided to call her great grandmother anyway nana mom was preparing lunch the other day and she cut the ends off of the ham before she cooked it i asked her why and she said she thought it was because the juices would absorb better making it tenderer she told me to ask grandma to make sure since she learned it from her well i called grandma and she said the same thing about the juices and all but that she learned it from you and i should ask you so nana why do you cut the ends off of a ham before you cook it there was a long pause in the conversation and then the little girl heard what sounded like muffled laughter coming from the other end of the line what s so funny nana oh sweetie i always cut the ends off of a ham before i cooked it because my pan was too small western oregon sent sara tucholsky to the plate with two runners on base she

realised that sketches makes me go past my own comfort zones its a really tiny zone they inspire me and give me new ideas that i wouldnt even have tought about normally the book continues with a chapter on 1920s 30s night clubs the bottle parties of the jazz age where the likes of the redoubtable mrs meyrick opened clubs in soho basements negotiating with both corrupt policemen and criminal gangs always bouncing back after arrest and imprisonment then finally a chapter on the windmill theatre famous for its nude tableau run by the eccentric mrs henderson back to their penned plot at the pond house when i was a kid i wanted the intercontinental belt i wanted to wear it around my waist go to school and exert dominance upon my international peers claiming that i was better and america was number one because the champion of all continents was an american to me that title meant something more than just a heavy piece of metal with a fancy design on it but the years have humbled me and my patriotism has matured and now i have an idea of what the belt would mean to me now as irony would have it it still represents that dominance in a way but not in a smarmy i m better than you but an

last week she had told her children that it was her time what i found seemed to echo itself with every personal account of every poor mother that i came across we are made to feel ashamed of ourselves because of that we often hide the fact that we are on welfare from other people social workers have numerously made all of us cry tears of frustration at one point or another first of all most places that you query will have a response time listed somewhere whatever that response time is i find it s best to just forget about it for as long as you can why because you don t want to go crazy with anticipation that s why of course you probably won t be able to forget because you studied the market and chose to send your precious manuscript to this particular agent editor publisher for a reason right so take that response time and add a few months to it the horror but people in publishing are busy they have stacks and stacks and stacks of words to read a person can only do so much so fast what i like to do is wait until i can barely stand it funny how this usually coincides with the listed response time and then wait at least another two months before i status query yes i said two months maybe even three why to give the person the time to read my manuscript without the added knowledge that i have been bugging them to do so as we lift jesus up in our lives and accept him as our savior the sweet savor of his sacrifice is lifted up to god in this god is pleased as he writes our names into the lamb s book of life showing us that he is pleased with the sweet aroma of grace we are the fragrance of christ in him we have our gifts grace and comfort he is the good news which we proclaim to the world the sweet aroma and fragrance of the sweet presence of christ in our hearts is made possible by his blood righteousness sacrifice and grace it is as we find ourselves basking in his glory forgiven by his blood that our lives reflect the gift of god in christ jesus and we become a sweet fragrance to god in this we are grateful and well pleasing to the lord as we show forth his glory and honor proclaiming salvation to the world comfort to hurting and lost and victory to the enemy i decided sherlock holmes would be a great test subject for my foray into using an electronic reading device because out of all the public domain classics it seemed one of the least sacrilegious to read on a screen holmes was pretty up the to the minute technology wise he wouldn t be offended by being read in digital form would he yes i worry about these things also they are short stories so i would only need to survive the kindle for short periods of time the plot was well paced and interesting the novel does end on a bit of a cliff hanger but leads in well to the next in the series i m definitely going to be continuing reading these books this station is one of the most interesting because there is absolutely no advertising which on any other stop is very common it s a refreshing stop full of primary color visuals instead of ads says me who does advertising for a living it s also the bright reminder that i ve crossed the seine and am only about six stops away from french class mother why not 2 note card sets may good luck pursue you each morning and night saturday i was getting ready to leave for work and our upstairs neighbor knocked on the door which is pretty unusual for

years i got to keep a solid set of sisters and nothing much has changed over the years well except for our different career paths but other than that we re basically the same old crazy ass girls who kicked and fought our way through elementary and high school life together they were both armed with guns wearing gloves and balaclavas and were approaching soldiers who believed that their lives were

is a universe of beliefs and ideas and theories to cross the line is to leave all that behind no theory concept belief opinion or debate can have any possible basis in reality once the ramifications of the cogito have fully saturated the mind no dialogue can take place across that line because nothing that makes sense on either side makes sense on the other we all think we know what the cogito

am much younger than he thought i was when we met bobby was a hit back in the 1960 s and i was born in the mid 60 s i always said i grew up in the wrong era the music from the 50 s and 60 s were always my favorites growing up i got into the back room and i think its unchanged apart from maybe a repaint its still the best place in the pub for a chat and you can get service at the hatch which is good there was also some space reserved in the main room for the musicians it appears free music is still available although a low turn out last night was suggested by the performer to be because they d put the prices up which isn t true this was a rare instance where i did no pre planning just took scissors to paper and ended up with a project that s pretty special to me this layout is going on an easel in the craft room as an example of how spontaneity can be a wonderful thing but what i am especially grateful for is the relationship i have with god and the many blessings he has given to

teacher bullying it breaks my heart to think about the way children teenagers treat certain people it breaks my heart even more to hear of how this can lead some young people to feel like their only option is to take their own life why do we put a value on people why are some people worth more than others to us what makes us think we re better than anyone else this is a huge problem that only seems to be getting worse this scares me the total exhaustion i felt last week is waning now i am just tired by this time next month i will be giddy with renewed energy because it will be the last days of the school year sunshine yard work and a couple of days at the beach will be like heaven there s been a lot of interest in bucket lists ever since the inspiring movie with morgan freeman and jack nicholson came out it s a wonderful idea making a list of things you want to do before you kick the bucket in the movie morgan freeman waits until he has a terminal illness to make his list which raises the question in my mind why wait i wouldn t be tactless enough to include an amazon link but they are available from all good booksellers and no doubt some bad ones too the mentor shadow program should be obvious in a country this large we need to develop as many top level coaches in every discipline that we can across the nation i would even look to develop regional coaches directories along with regional coaching development programs that put coaches like john smith alberto salazar bobby kersee and dick booth together with their peers to exchange information techniques this should be mandatory for all coaches who want to work on international programs because we want to replicate their success we want as many athletes as possible benefiting from their knowledge similarly the athlete referral program would take elite athletes and put them in touch with coaches that can help shore up their weaknesses for example while a walter dix has his own coach he and his coach could be referred to jon drummond for analysis and tweaking of his start mechanics again without disrespect to their personal coaches acceptance of referrals should almost be a mandatory component of competing on international teams as we want those athletes competing in the red white and blue competing at their absolute maximum potential the flowers are from prima marketing the swirl

if you want to skip making the nachos hadot emphasizes that what the concentration on the present and view from above have in common is that both in a sense assume the view of the world which is radically depersonalizing in the concentration on the present past and future fall away and there is bare life life stripped down radically but as this awareness brings us into contact with the passing of this present we inevitably shift to the view from above which is the world as it looks without us for hadot this is the world viewed from the perspective of our own death and hadot is right

with different sizes of metal boxes used as risers it was one of those vignettes that i wasn t in a hurry to change however the recent warmer temperatures have motivated me to haul out the spring decor instead of putting away all the clocks i decided to simply include them in other vignettes around the house we went to the chicken swap in milford this past weekend and you guessed it we picked

the same time because its smaller you will probably have more trouble finding one the nice thing is that any job you manage to get will allow you a very nice quality of life because its good in general terms in terms of immigration there s very few immigrant which i like a lot a lot of people still think that northern ireland is a warzone where catholics and protestants still bomb each other on daily basis not so while there is the occasional incident here and there its not common and rarely gets people seriously injured or killed among the middle class people i guess we all just want to get along in spite of the different political agendas each one may have and simply live in peace besides certain specific locations where segregation still exists there s no clash between immigrants of different cultural and religious backgrounds i read how sometimes in england they have these islamic terrorists the diversity gets shoved down people s throats because its so different people forced to live almost one on top of the other an added benefit to that is that being the rare immigrant people are more opened to you and less suspicious locals are surprised you even chose to immigrate here why did you move here my answer is because it s a great place to live in that brings a smile to people s faces and they quickly agree proud that someone thinks that way instead of just

street movement and the economic unrest in europe is a part of the process of remembering who we are and an important transition into a new economic reality the occupy movement is focussing anger at

eos sent out a sampler of their books to reviewers and as i was paging through the selections i took one look at the title and was ready to keep flipping pages but for some odd reason i read the first page then the second page and then well eos had only provided the first three chapters and by the time i d flipped the last page i was hungry for more brains this book has a lot of brains both literally and figuratively it s a smart gory laugh out loud tale of sentient zombies on a quest to find salvation or do they just want brains what i do know is that the guy at the hobby shop was pretty stoked he gave us fifty bucks for the final mementos of jeff s youth hopefully the toys will find a good home and spark the imagination of some young kid and for you enthusiasts out there don t

is capable of perceiving and what sort of abilities he is capable of exercising he takes this idea further though and says modern models of reality those based on materialism and the scientific method

similarities are alarming at times he loves us even though we screw up he loves without ceasing and showers us with gifts being the father figure to the whole world he just has to do this a whole bunch more than we do as fathers of our own children this is not to be taken lightly however to be a full fledged instrument of the lord means to love him above all else as he loves us above all else we must crave a loving relationship with the creator that loved us so much that he sent his only son to the cross in our stead to truly love someone you have to be able to do a few basic things 1 love them all the time and not just when it suits you 2 forgive them when they wrong you as jesus forgave even his persecutors 3 repeat the above 2 steps always and unconditionally you see to love someone fully you must be able to live with their faults you must be able to see past their exterior and know their heart god can do all these things he constructed me and my heart and he knows the inner plan that my heart has going on at the present and past we are constantly told through scripture to love those around us but how many of us really live this out i know for a fact that i don t i hold wrath most of the time when wronged when i could as easily just forgive and pray about the solution that i would have likely made instead god calls us to a higher standard than anyone else as followers in his name he can give his all to love us why can we not give our all to love him back it is a fundamental disconnect with our maker that if we ever figure out will bless us richer than we could ever

two nights during the week i get the opportunity to hang out with a 16 month old it s funny how life s lessons can be taught through these sessions tonight as i was going through the normal routine of bathing getting jammies brushing teeth dosing ty ty and reading stories i was yet again reminded of where my priorities need to be although here i am writing instead of reading as griffin and i sat on the floor in his room i asked him to pick out a few stories for me to read the first story was thank you god for the animals his second being super snowy day he quickly was sick of that story and grabbed for another book as i went to grab the book he opened it and low and behold it was opened to the story of easter in his baby s 1st bible the message was pretty clear at that point and i try not feel too bad letting her watch so much of her furry man after all he is a very good influence he is always so happy and so polite and always has such a positive attitide i remember when emme grace

spiral a fast paced and gritty french drama following the investigations of laure berthaud and her squad little seems to separate the flics and the delinquents here violence and corruption are everywhere and everyone is tainted berthaud s drive to root out evil doers seems driven by obsession rather than morality and she seems destined to destroy both herself and those around her in the process of the three series available the first and third are most worthwhile but it s all compelling viewing i just couldn t get over laure s hair in series two of course this country has its faults its full of fatties third worlders and overweening liberals the elite who comprise media government academia and big business have wholly abandoned the rest of the nation and in some cases have openly

i would never recommend to an author but he s stephen king and can do what he wants so who am i to complain for one thing king s direct reader address using you works well in this book and helps me believe in jake as a normal person who is just as confused as i about why and how this is all happening as a general rule however i do not like direct address and do not recommend trying it without supervision king also foreshadows a lot which works for increasing the suspense though often i find that authors want to utilize this tool in an ineffective way ie foreshadowing too much and if i were to voice a minor complaint it would be that at times the foreshadowing does feel a bit excessive this morning i was rushing around trying to get everything and everyone in the right place when i just

attention that certain types of products may be infringing the disclosure contained in application 10 999 999 but not literally claimed accordingly applicant is submitting new claims that would encompass the potentially infringing products would that be sufficient philosophers from plato onward have struggled to define what is true and come up with some way of understanding our sensations and experiences in a rational and intelligible way in modern times we have access to more information than ever before that deluge of information can be overwhelming but this is the environment we

situation email the support people and explain to them that i am unaware of breaking the tofa however i will remove the content if need be ask them what i had done that had lead to the event of my blog being removed everything was restored pretty quickly but it had been enough time for me to think it had been taken away creating a sickening feeling in my stomach at the thought of not only at what had been lost but also because it felt as if my right to be a human being with individual and shared thoughts had been taken off me date published october 15th 2011 i want to stop and listen i

holidays you have lots of time to dream and plan for the future it s everything you want to happen but you know you won t do it in real life i can t tell you how many times i have told her i love her and how many times she s told me before i could the main problem about doing that in real life is that i can t really do anything when i m around her i never remember how you re supposed to act so i always forget a plan that i was going to carry out or a hint that i had thought of beforehand the only thing i can do is remind myself to just keep quiet and stay controlled on one practice she even

i care about taking three pages and turning it one page then from one page into three paragraphs then from three paragraphs into one paragraph and finally from one paragraph into one perfectly distilled sentence trusting god the almighty through the way of jesus seemed insufficient for these teachers who were adding to the gospel jesus from the beginning of his ministry to his death demonstrated by his life the way of life that is pleasing to god we see this in the way he preached prayed and the interactions he had with his neighbors he interacted with people he empathized and sympathized and was touched and touched people s life he is therefore an example of how one should love god and love his neighbor he fully trusted in his god and loved him with all his heart and soul he never worried about what he would eat where he would live or desired to be rich under the old covenant the animal sacrifices that people offered as examples of how one should live their lives for instance a lamb or bull without blemish or defect symbolized a life of total dedication to god jesus demonstrated this in his life when i was a small child my mom would throw my brother and i in the tub at the same time for a bath saving time and energy i m sure it was lots of fun because we had those sliding glass doors on our tub we d close the doors and have diving contests i wonder if my mom realizes that we were just one super dive away from stitches we enjoyed trying to see how big a splash we could make out of all of our tub toys the three men in a tub really stands out to me a butcher a baker and a candlestick maker few things seem more elusive to me why these professions and where exactly were these three men headed in that tub anyway needless to say they survived many a rogue

product it s beautiful said kowalski later after all the players were done with the tryouts for their chairs the two men came out and the moment we had all been waiting for arrived they said there were two people they wanted to move up into the first violin section and that was a lady named carol and another lady named amy amy that was my name they wanted me to move up into the first violin section they had to have been mistaken but they weren t so i moved over the lady i had to sit next to was now below me and i thought she was a better player she spoke softly to me saying that she had done lousy on her performing the tryout piece i replied that i must have played too well since i was moved up into first violins and i felt i was nowhere near ready for that the stretch to mile marker

proliferation is relative and makes me think of profiteroles which makes me think cookies which of course makes me want to slack around some more in the months and days leading up to the release of crazy stupid love i heard no such thing nobody was saying this was a romantic comedy made with the man in mind so imagine my surprise when i watched it this morning csl succeeds at being a romantic comedy guys can get into because it doesn t make love soft or easy as most men who have been in love know it to be i imagine a lot of this has to do with the fact that the film is the work of not one but two male directors glenn ficarra and john requa it s as though they were trying to fit in every experience they had or heard about love and marriage through each of the three male protagonists we

blind however is an account based on many works in the louvre of sighted artists images of blindness but how can we convey the sound of deafness the ecstatic and angular final works of beethoven such as the late string quartets the diabelli variations and piano sonata no 32 in c minor op 111 are astonishing achievements in abstraction and testaments to the visuality of musical composition but how would a hearing composer denote a deaf world perhaps they can t and don t need to for if the human sensorium is a gestalt and a change in one part of it changes the whole we might expect that when one door of perception closes another opens blind poets and musicians from homer to stevie wonder have been celebrated and admired perhaps their courage and intensity of truth saying is something we

arrived on the william carey international university campus in pasadena california on the shuttle i met two girls that were headed to training as well elizabeth and spencer and was a little less nervous because i suddenly knew i wasn t in this alone almost instantly upon arriving on campus god melted my heart a little and opened my mouth and eyes to new experiences before me anyone who knows me at all knows that i am by no means a social butterfly i tend to avoid large groups sometimes to the extreme and don t really speak unless it is initiated by someone else however this journey began with that dropping it didn t take me any more than 30 minutes to be headed down the street with 5 other trainees headed out to get lunch it was so amazing and weird to me that i began actually talking to people i was interacting and not shutting people out that night we were formally introduced to our groups and there was an instant connection i m not going to jump in and say after a week i know that i m going to be bff s with my group members but god really knew what he was doing in the cambodia group there are 8 people 7 girls and 1 guy i can t explain it but it didn t even take an hour to

challenging dizaei they indulge in politicised manoeuvres designed to protect their own backs and further their own careers the internet is rather shy about providing much more information about the band and all i can really glean from the limited scraps available is that sounds magazine rated them highly and predicted they would conquer all before them which obviously never happened that

baby c is overtired too since he hasn t made up for the sleep he is losing at night so i am dedicated to getting him to take a nap this afternoon he took a typically short one this morning but it is clearly not enough the book said that it can take as long as an hour the first time that you try to get them to self soothe by checking on them every 5 minutes or so i am willing to try that as the

must get new picture asap one saturday morning my husband and i were waiting for the bank to open when we pulled into the parking lot we noticed two or three county police cars in the roadway and a line of mostly young people standing outside of a sports store i waited in the car as my husband made his way to the bank which was not yet open so he returned to the car and told me what was going on a sport s shoe company was due to release the latest in a line of tennis shoes costing 263 00 and the people were in line to be the first to purchase a pair the policemen were there in case things got out of hand my first inclination was to judge and condemn those in line a stronghold that i had to deal with emotions of disgust and pride threatened to enter my mind and my intellect perfectly described the state of this slow economy that we are in my desire was to preach to them of better ways to spend their resources then the word of god came in with matthew 7 1 judge not that ye be not judged and my pastor s statement we must restore this generation my spirit aided by the holy spirit quickened my mind reminding me of the time when i was their age and had to have or coveted a leather jacket and every color of a particular then popular brand of leather shoes a clear result of the lust of the eye and the pride of life 1 john 2 16 i had to repent and i say again renewing the mind is

only resulted in the water spraying everywhere i grabbed around for one of the raincoats and i found one under a sopping wet parka that suddenly weighed 20 pounds i put it halfway on with one hand then quickly switched my hands on the faucet and finished getting the coat on i was already soaking wet i m not sure why i thought putting on a coat would be a good idea at the time maybe it was years of conditioning by my parents i pulled the hood up over my head and looked around again there were now two inches of water on the bottom of the closet of course that trip was easy and quick so i

of us and wear his ear buds with his music playing during meals so he couldn t hear us this has helped a bit he does inhale his entire plate of food in like 90 seconds so he can get away from us entirely but at least he s in the room with us up until then so we still have the barest illusion of family mealtime we ve learned that the only real medical treatment for misophonia so far is anti

me to go into the water you can see how much i m freaking out in the second picture i just remember her yelling just get in get in it s just water but the waves oh the waves coming in they were just intimidating me as i pondered i would take a step forward but as soon as i saw them charging at me i would take several steps back my hands were sweating my legs were going numb and my heart was racing but how exactly am i supposed to enjoy this beautiful island if i don t take a step in eventually i got there the waves left me as soon as mella took this shot no worries though there will be

second career win and came extremely close but such is the nature of racing my reasoning for picking truex jr as the driver of the week is because of how well he has been racing the past few weeks and

publication sent to alums and others probably mostly for the purposes of inspiring donations to the college but of moderate interest anyway for the articles and other news items over the last twenty

services and bible studies reading books as well as personal experiences but always leave room to be amazed god is so much greater than we think he s bigger grander more loving more miraculous than we

a dslr unique is the use of interchangeable lenses the mirror and pentaprism after a specific lens is mounted a mirror behind the lens reflects the light upward to a 5 sided prism or pentaprism where it is reflected through the viewfinder when the shutter release is pressed the mirror just behind the lens flips up to allow a straight path between the light and the shutter the shutter opens for the

together father of deities the young man second from the right in this picture is my mother s only brother sydney william known as billy he can be seen in several of my other posts where my mum features as a girl because billy never seemed to be far away mum was only sixteen months younger and although they had their spats they were close with billy always looking out for his little sister billy left school in 1933 when he was fourteen times were very hard in the thirties and many grown men with families were finding it difficult to make ends meet from 1931 1935 the unemployment total in great britain never fell below two million and at its highest point in the winter of 1932 3 it almost reached three million my grandfather was frequently laid off and i imagine the family would have been very pleased that billy was accepted as a tiler s apprentice at the midland plastering company in nottingham not something he yearned to do but then like now you took what was offered there was no question of further education as families needed every penny being an apprentice meant that you learned a trade as well the following year billy died in an non work related accident in june 1934 and mum s final term at school was a very sad one when mum left school she went to work in boots offices in station street nottingham she had to stand on a box to reach the top drawer of the filing cabinet as she was not very tall she was the nicknamed little cherub and was a bit of a favourite of the rest of the office staff when mum finally left their employment one of the bosses mr lawson gave her a one pound note and told her to always keep it safe as a reserve for hard times surely a good lesson for life made me feel like he was the cure hope you enjoyed this first iron chef

mirrors or looking around or motorcyclists playing extreme games of chicken with a300ton trucks unfortunately i was gripping on to the handlebars too hard to take any photos documenting the chaos that

being pitched in certain quarters as a thriller of the le carré variety but i think it will become quickly obvious to any fan of the classic spy thrillers that that s not the kind of novel brophy had in mind certainly he seems more than happy to play with the tropes and conventions of the spy novel the secret service spooks in london recruiting unwilling spies via blackmail the east berlin setting the secretive missions false identities and dead letter drops the sense of claustrophobia and paranoia but any fan of le carré ambler et al will be underwhelmed by the berlin crossing as a spy novel

computer games that only allow you to see the room you are in and no more i don t get to see beyond the next footstep yet god has never ever taken me down a wrong path in fact when i follow him i find myself being who i am really meant to be i am doing and being all i am created to do and be let me point it out very clear for everyone i am a practicing jew who believes in the torah i accept the oral tradition and believe that it goes back to moshe rabenu a s as well as i believe that we should follow halachah we being the jews but i also believe in the ethical teachings of r hillel z l and therefore i don t want to do to others what is hateful for me i don t want to force rules or laws on people which isn t decided by the general population there will always be those who disagree no matter the law or decision therefore i don t believe that halachah should be forced on people who don t believe in its higher level of spirituality compared to secular law and our own faulty decisions yes i do believe halachah to be divine and i do believe that the perfect society would be following halachah but it would do it from an understanding of the necessity of the halachah not because they are forced and to be honest by establishing a halachic society with torah as the foundation we would need a true righteous leader one who would be the example for the others to follow and he simply doesn t exist his time hasn t come and since that is the case then i can t support any state as being lead by halachah but rather want to encourage each jew to accept it in his or her life for themselves only by acknowledging and accepting it themselves would it be able to fulfill its divine purpose in our lives since february to be exact the first part mentioning the names is the isnad the chain leading the message of the hadith the matn back to muhammad and what he said is the matn the message many employers now don t use the jobcentre they use recruitment agencies instead while this may seem logical it makes it a bit of a nightmare for the jobhunter objection 3 but i don t need a priest i can go directly to god and ask forgiveness needless to say there is much more to rand s work than the strategic thought of albert wohlstetter and abella s book is an introduction to the broad range of ideas rand has espoused from rational choice theory explaining all human behavior in terms of self interest to the systematic execution of vietnamese in the cia s phoenix program during the vietnam war as an institution the rand corporation remains one of the most potent and complex purveyors of american imperialism a full assessment of its influence both positive and sinister must await the elimination of the secrecy surrounding its activities and further historical and

the feedback given is often in a poor format there are usually general statements covering a broad sweep of behaviours and impresions rather than being issue specific worse still feedback can focus on who the person is rather than the actions they have taken feedback should try to concentrate on actual events not inference and speculation the general comments often offered are not always helpful for a trainee to think about more helpful and a better substrate for examining ones behaviour are examples of specific situations where a behaviour has influenced others either for better or for worse

the 12 km run it was as if the whole running community was there the race started at 5 30 am along the relatively mild flat kinrara golf club a few minutes into the race my mp3 player died right after moves like jagger i didn t feel right having the mute headphones stuck to my ears and decided to slow down to remove them before resuming my first silent race but that was okay really throughout the race i d seen runners waving and wishing each other a happy new year i even heard someone saying gong hei fatt choi that s the reason why i like small scale races like this they are more intimate and

father sigh i know that there are republicans who say they are representing the will of the people by blocking issues from coming up in congress someone explain to me how the super majority of 60 votes is representative of the will of the people it in fact drives minority rule to the extreme one senator can command payoffs by withholding his vote if the filibuster is a tactic in the senate then i think they should actually have to filibuster the old fashioned way senators take the floor hold the floor through the night through the day until finally one side has to negotiate a position as the business of the senate is simply not going to happen until the issue is resolved the way the filibuster rule works now it has just added a layer obstruction to the work of the senate at least under the old method nothing got done as long as senators held the floor now they just have a vote and go on to obstruct other important work shall you not know it a second article written recently also adds worry that the anti evolution movement is gathering pace worldwide it lists a couple of examples of how evolution is being attacked one case is that in kenya a bitter dispute is taken place as the plan of exhibiting a prehistoric human skeleton is being opposed by local religious forces another example involves a well funded turkish publishing house mass distributing anti evolution books to french speaking schools and universities across europe the article also shows an example from russia and of course there is the well known intelligent design movement that is currently taking place

someday all is well is arranged in such a way to offer shifting relationships on its core themes of guilt naivete vs wisdom death love and faith there are three strands running through the album the guilt theme cutting across wild bill jones fall on my knees and prodigal son the romance theme stretching through sugar baby saro wedding dress and little satchel and the inquiry into mortality at first abstractly marking little johnny brown and then directly approached in o death and all is well it s as if with the progression of the record amidon s narrators grow increasingly world weary and knowing or in other instances such as in the approach to love more juvenile one can witness the palpable release of fear from the protagonist of o death by the time he gets to all is well in which the greeting of death at least lyrically suggests an awakening similarly the knee jerk gun slinging of wild bill jones in the event of heavy jealousy gives way obliquely to the devastating weight of guilt

heaney is one of the greatest living poets today in the english language and his words will last and last so here s what i did but simpler sweeter what the push past it so 11 hears ago this may jeffrey s parents found our land up for auction it was 7 acres with a 100 year old barn and house jeffrey s granddaddy worked as a very young boy throwing hay in our loft how cool is that the barn we have restored the house was too far gone so we tore it down and built our carriage house 1200 square feet over the garage to get on our property and thought we would live there for 2 3 years and then start our house well here we are 9 plus years later but we have had to make sacrifices like a bigger house for me to be able to stay home with our girls and it has been worth every crowded little

answering one simple question what passport did he use when he was shuttling between new york jakarta and karachi in most of the country progressive activists are known for their defenses of civil liberties and their sometimes reflexive and overheated criticism of alleged police and or prosecutorial misconduct this record often has led to progressives being attacked as soft on crime but there

own farm such a thorough review and so thoroughly reflects my thoughts on the film that i have little to add beyond this very minor quibble sometimes the filmmakers engage in a bit of narrative sleight of hand withholding information from the audience in order to have their tada moments suddenly springing key developments upon the audience in a rather unnecessarily manipulative way it s a magical spot james cameron avatar isn t education generally a form of slavery or servitude i didn t say i don t love you anymore kid really where looking around on the pantry shelves i love this no work thing what s for dinner by the way i see rifftrax will be doing the same thing this year with house on haunted hill and i was set to go until i found that it was the same evening as the nold puppet show and i think you all know where my loyalties lay in that regard since mo ibrahim is never going to be able to afford to pay more than what a smallish arms deal yields maybe he should consider dumping the project and give up on the fruitless search for a credible african politician the money would be better spent on people who are not politicians there are plenty of remarkable south africans of all races who do much more to create a better world than do the politicians they don t drive around in fancy bmws paid for by the taxpayer or have lunches costing r100 000 they just get on with difficult tasks in very difficult circumstances they are the people who deserve an award and a pile of cash or preferably just the cash the statesman says tire slashing has been rampant in hyde park for 15 years but i can personally attest that it s been going on for at least 18 years back in 1993 when i lived in a decrepit apartment at the corner of 39th and speedway it wasn t uncommon to see two or more cars with two or more slashed tires in the streetside parking lot he never got me though i m always happy to admit it if i m wrong and i was very wrong about this album at first it took a long time for the serpentine structures and bracing staggering rhyme schemes of this experimental hip hop outfit to sink in with me if at first i found it simply impenetrable i ve still been compelled to revisit black up over and over again until it opened up its delights to me and it s packed with plenty of delights the work of former digable planets mc ishmael butler and multi instrumentalist tendai maraire black up is a dense and unusual hip hop album which is why it required some period of adjustment butler s raps are often just simplistic repeated chants incantatory announcements intoned over woozy drunken beats that seem to be stumbling over each other at other times the rapper delivers pattering fast paced verses packed with clever wordplay the music is by turns jazzy soulful and discordant often within a single track and there s almost always a heavy buzzing bass presence that allows the complex song structures to hang together there s even room on the record s back end for guest appearances from female soul duo theesatisfaction whose voices provide a contrast against butler s nasal raps on a few tracks especially the fractured lounge jazz of endeavors for never this is bold exciting music all the more rewarding for the time it took me to get used to its intriguingly askew approach to hip hop buy hello again hopefully you have been

realize why pick ups are such an obsession knowledge is power the simplicity of the statement conceals its implications basically the more you know the bigger your advantage the less you know the bigger your disadvantage for that reason restriction and suppression of information is a very basic social control technique very basic and very easy given that control of the media has been consolidated into such few hands failing to consider the aims and effects of the overall media output as well as its detail is dangerously naïve even a cursory glance at facts reveals mainstream media s worrying links policies and agendas whatever you see on television hear on the radio or read in the newspapers has been at the very least allowed more often than not though it has been meticulously

turbotax to continue my return good luck to all of you in your tax filing what do you all like to spend your return on if you get one i d love to hear the river ganges flows by calcutta sometimes within the water there are many stools and other dirty things which are washed away from neighboring mills and factories but still thousands of men take baths in the ganges water and they are very healthy as well as spiritually inclined that is the effect of ganges water the ganges is glorified because it emanates from the toes of the lotus feet of the lord similarly if one takes to the service of the lotus feet of the lord or takes to kṛṣṇa consciousness he is immediately cleansed of the many dirty things which have accumulated in his innumerable births we have seen that in spite of the very black record of their past lives persons who take to kṛṣṇa consciousness become perfectly cleansed of all dirty things and make spiritual progress very swiftly therefore pṛthu mahārāja advises that without the benediction of the supreme lord one cannot make advancement either in so called morality economic development or sense gratification one should therefore take to the service of the lord or kṛṣṇa consciousness and thus very soon become a perfect man as confirmed in bhagavad gītā kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā śaśvac chāntiṁ nigacchati being a responsible king pṛthu mahārāja recommends that everyone take shelter of the supreme personality of godhead and thus be immediately purified lord śrī kṛṣṇa also says in bhagavad gītā that simply by surrendering unto him one is immediately relieved of all sinful reactions as kṛṣṇa takes away all the sinful reactions of a person immediately upon his surrender unto him similarly the external manifestation of kṛṣṇa the representative of kṛṣṇa who acts as the mercy of the supreme personality of godhead takes all the resultant actions of the sinful life of the disciple immediately after the disciple s initiation thus if the disciple follows the principles instructed by the spiritual master he remains purified and is not contaminated by the material infection then there was the fact that i had at last a disposable income meaning that a real holiday was a possibility in fact my first foreign holiday was from an advert in the union newspaper i ve always been a union man there was a special offer for a package to yugoslavia i had some discussions with a colleague about a joint trip but she pulled out and i went on in some corner of the many worlds multiverse we fell in love got married and had many children a narrow escape so in the middle of all this craziness over this person who thinks she can sell free patterns in her etsy shop and get away with it my dear friend carol dean sharpe finds this on youtube over the

get tired of it josh and i are planning to go to shabu shabu tomorrow we decided on just treating each other to dinner instead of exchanging gifts do you think taking a picture of vinci s joconde at the louvre museum and printing it ten times to your friends which will print it ten times for their friends also is stealing the actual painting sure it s not and it has never been it has nothing to

taking a very spontaneous quick trip to amsterdam leaving tomorrow here s the story we were planning to take toby to europe this summer but we priced out the flights and it was prohibitively expensive summer flights to most major european cities started at 1400 and we d need to buy three we figured our europe dreams were dashed until we realized that if we squeezed a trip in april the flights were much less expensive and the overall trip would be doable if we stayed for just a handful of days by request of a special bumpie you know who you are this is just for you it s aimed towards encouraging

itself to take action on its own behalf and a united front of media vilification can be guaranteed big business and big government can rely on the media s support should any significant confrontation

claim to have made the first beer without malted barley just as bard s tale has said well i don t really care who was the first new grist is my absolute favorite of the three it is very light and refreshing and they do a good job at making it taste most like an actual malted barley beer i have read other reviews where people have just ripped it and i don t get it yea it may not have the flavor of an imperial stout but they did a great job of making something flavorful for the gluten intolerant crowd and i commend them for it the death of the gateway corridor project and the impending doom that will befall north amherst village center form based rezoning this coming monday night is directly attributable to a mis perception in town that those worthy projects will create more rowdy

coaches mary guaraldi and john raymond kofonow i try the tactic of encouraging my kids and giving them assistance when they get frustrated but little s is never this calm at home this is the child that screams in frustration when she can t get on her shoe on the first try i ve even enlisted some deep breathing techniques to help her reduce her frustration levels which helps calm her a bit but her performance at school was that of an angel and although i m not sure coach spitzer made me into a great player she did substitute my fear of getting hit with the hockey stick into a fear of her

thing that i have done this past week was a doctor and a dentist visit for excitement you would think i could do better than that i tried to pad my excitement account with a visit to the nursing home i have a new friend who is a patient across the hall from my sister and she is a delight to visit she is past her 100th birthday her mind is in better shape than mine she is always in a cheerful mood and she likes me i always leave feeling exhilarated from my visit with her she and my sister both accept their confinement with such courage and contentment that it is a pleasure to spend time with them my aunt is there too but she has trouble hearing me so that makes a conversation much more difficult my elderly friend quoted a scripture to me the last time i was there about god s mysterious ways his wonders to perform and said it was certainly a good thing she fell and broke her arm resulting in her stay at the nursing home or she would have never met me what a way to build someone s ego whenever i feel let down and alone it is a real treatment to visit with her and it fills my day with magic moments it is a pleasure to fill her request for me to be sure and come back that s right

you don t know the first thing about me you should consider that when you question my methods and decisions i splash some chilean wine okay i ll stop in truth mr brooks is a work of stupid genius and it s completely fucking hilarious it s not just bad it s insane and begging for some mst3k treatment like nothing i ve seen since perhaps mindhunters but to be serious for a moment i must admit i m relieved to know that i am exempt from being stalked and killed by mr brooks by virtue of the fact that i don t own a vacuum cleaner how the grid ages i swear irl you can t see any vnl however in these photos it seems so obvious having said that i did enjoy the story for the most part it has an interesting premise i would be tempted to read others in the series but more so watch the tv show i

extensive specific fact finding as detailed supra with respect to each of the argued claims appellants argument as detailed supra repeatedly restates elements of the claim language and simply argues that the elements are missing from the reference however appellants do not present any arguments to explain why the examiner s explicit fact finding is in error arguments not presented in the appeal brief will be refused consideration by the board unless good cause is shown i e are waived in contrast the examiner findings address each claim limitation raised on appeal by appellants and also these

sublime experts at the university of california at san diego made the discovery by studying mice and human cells cultured in their laboratory as an aside corbin was a former student of mine and i am thrilled to hear he s beating his battle with cancer it is but our way to deny responsibility conclusion the food here is very fresh very tasty well presented and i doubt you can go wrong with any of their dishes my only complaint is their prices my wife says her meal was worth the money and i think therein lies the issue they have priced up all the meat dishes well but when it came to the vegetarian dishes instead of looking at what they were giving the customer they just looked at the general prices across the menu and said well there s no meat so just knock a couple of quid off and keep them somewhat inline with the rest of the prices on the menu a simple fix to that of course is not to change the prices but to just give a little more on the veggie plates where the meat would have been there is no denying the food here is good we ll be back again but with prices like these i don t think it will be for a long time if you re in the area and want really good food and have money to throw around here is the place to pop into if you just want a meal and don t want to break the bank its probably best to pop over to the huntsman across the road whilst the staff didn t mind at all i would say the swan inn attracts a certain type of customer who don t really want to be bothered by children so i would say only take the kids if they re older or if younger well behaved lastly the menu did lack options on it it would have been really good to see a veggie burger on there because there s no way for a veggie to have any onion rings handcut chips or any of the niceties that come accompained with the other meals had i been alone i would never have been able to compliment the delcious homemade coleslaw so a homemade veggie burger option would be much welcomed other than that i would recommend coming in when the restaurant is open as by the looks of that menu whilst still expensively priced there are more options for us veg heads is just right for the veil and

glimmering through the groaning trees scenarios and predictions are presented before you in an effort to get you to create the possibility of the scenario presented happening we ask you to think and feel upon the miracles that events such as disclosure and our presence among you will bring but you must create these scenarios yourselves or they will never manifest here in the higher realms anything manifests instantly through thought and feeling though of course it is not as easy to manifest things in the lower dimensions the events you have been reading and hearing about that have been

out to many adoption groups pleading for a new group of older orphans who needed families they are all listed as healthy the broadcast e mail read they are in danger of turning 14 and ageing sic out this means they may have no support or resources and have to live on their own in china if they are not adopted before they turn 14 this particular group would become known as the first journey of hope program through wacap one of the largest china adoption programs in the u s emails went out and word spread through the yahoo groups discussing wacaps new program which included the luoyang orphanage adoption group where adoptive families were advocating for children soon to be aging out of that orphanage which comprised the majority of the children on wacap s list one luoyang adoptive parent wrote of a program that was to get older kids adopted perhaps there is a new effort to get the older kids paperwork ready and have files in at ccaa maybe they are being added to ccaa s new shared list thirty or so agencies are now being tested with the new shared list of older or sn kids angel fire is being published by usborne on the 1st of october in about twenty minutes she turned

slow beginning 03 33 group dynamics in order for you to qualify for a job as a journalist at news international we require you to have a loreal rating of 1 500 for hanging out with friends i made up for my sins of no beer with dinner by playing darts and drinking a healthy amount of 512 bruin brown ale they had on cask hand pump at good ol gingerman this place was the polar opposite of 6th street bars lots of pea coats and tame beer love not going to see much vomit on the side of the road we actually managed to see some stars and used an android app to find all the constellations 1 cures no it didn t solve anything in fact in the dream i think she had managed to convince a judge to give her even more money which is why i finally lost it and figured it couldn t hurt to tell her like it is here are some observations from my first week and half with the little nugget so it is often said about march okay so we re actually into april now but only just and for today i am grateful for campbell s chicken and noodle soup but then i write 1000 2000 words and i still have 5000 words left to write close by the exit from the heart of darkness was a guest book in which visitors were invited to leave their impressions and comments elisabeth pointed to it and said hey are you going to speak out there maybe tell the truth pour into a large mug and enjoy here s a sweet picture bev came across of our youngest grandson zander who is almost 6 now enjoying a day of playing with rikkers in my search for the holy grail of products to keep my gorgeous but oh so slippery armani foundation on my face for more than 30 minutes i have come across a few duds see my review on mac s fix the point is that as born again believers in jesus christ we have a number of traits in common it is critical for you to embrace and embody these i am statements because out of them and as a result of them will come your words and actions as individuals and leaders when you do understand who you are in and because of jesus you will be powerful and confident in all that you do why because you know who is behind and who is beside and who is in front of you if i do not live from this foundation i may be a leader but not a biblical one until we read that i get it that i am created in his image i am a son of the living god i am loved and known by the creator of the universe along with all the rest of our i am statements you cannot live out his call on your life did you catch that only when you understand who you are in christ can you live out the call he has put on you question do you ever bring schoolwork to the gym with you what s your favorite way to get ready for a test i remember walking along suffolk street in mid october a saturday afternoon anyway i am now about 5 days behind on my blog so i m going to cut this one short so i can do a quick catch up one there is a rumour that we may get some coverage tomorrow i am so excited it s entirely possible of course that the 80 90 of everything is crap formulae is just getting higher yet at the same time we are being asked to buy more consume more to keep the economy going more in this case can include culture whether its dvds cinema tickets cds or poetry books how come i asked looks like i m thinking for example of the questionable confessions contradicted by dna evidence in the yogurt shop murders the texas court of criminal appeals criminal justice integrity unit heard a presentation on the case at an event they sponsored to educate themselves and the public on the subject of false confessions how a da reacts to exonerating dna evidence tells you a lot about their mindset they can admit a mistake apologize and continue the search for the real killer s perhaps even revisiting other confessions obtained by the same detective in austin s case hector polanco who notoriously tragically extracted a false confession from christopher ochoa as well as the yogurt shop defendants or they can spin out new theorems about some unindicted co ejaculator a hypothetical fifth mystery suspect supposedly present with the accused but accounted for neither in the questionable confessions nor the prosecution s theory at trial grits was disappointed the incumbent at first chose the latter path before finally grudgingly recommending charges be dismissed also i ve been dissatisfied that local jail diversion strategies haven t been more successful or always available to defendants with appointed counsel i don t know that i ll agree with judge baird in every instance but he has the experience and mettle for the job and i m confident he d be more open to change than the incumbent judi dench mrs brown i am in love with this color as an accent and i want to do some wall art similar to the one shown in this picture i don t have a before pic of my bath but that will come sometime down the road after lunch one group preferred shopping while the other preferred sightseeing the shopping group went to beijing street while the rest of us including me went to shamian island very similar to georgetown in penang then off we went to our next stop flower city square wow nice buildings he doesn t walk he runs always on a mission and usually up to no good he is going going going from wake up to naptime and then he crashes and then he s going and going and going until bedtime which only mommy can do because he only wants his mommy and he will scream bloody murder if he does not have his mommy mamamamamamamamama that s certainly the entirety of what i tasted here alcoholic ginger beer wea re to sit comfortably with eyes closed whilst kate our cardio nurse talks us through a scenario which we are to imagine unlived hitherto inebriating writing it was enough posting it would have been senseless sometimes you just have to let things go sometimes technology really does look out for you truth is i m at a stage where the next chapter is the point to which i ve been building it s also the one from which the momentum for the second half will begin it s important i get it right and you know what i m not sure i can okay this is the thing i would rather have a tiny box of godiva chocolates than a big box of something else the thing about tools you have to use them my resistance to this process has been successful i m hoping that my resistance will become futile i need to give in to the process and end this battle when i can upload some photos i ll show you the garden s progress our wall is almost finished it looks splendid in this simple article i will show you step by step how to create your own e book i am almost at the point where i have concluded that democracy doesn t work at least not in its present form critics of democracy point out that it carries the seeds of its own destruction and perhaps that is an accurate observation democracy is the rule of the mob and mobs are extremist and psychotic the french peasants who stormed the bastille were such a mob instead of celebrating july 14th as bastille day it should be a day of national mourning in france it was a day when madness replaced civilization when we go places i m the one who has to do everything to get kids ready deal with kids and keep them from melting down while were out and then deal with calming them down when we get home while he gets to enjoy whatever function we re at and yet he wonders why i don t like going places as a family i do all the effin work and don t even get to sit for 2mins how is that supposed to be fun or enjoyable for me 4 we display great endurance patience and joyful thanksgiving to god and on my students who are writing what they know living in foxcomm dorm as a line worker being the left behind lonely child of a migrant worker seeing your best friend s dad jailed for corruption astonishing have a lovely week end i m not convinced the material makes as much of an impact as the marketing would have you believe but i can t bring myself to shell out the cash to find out for real it s still painful to pay retail and i miss the days of equipment sponsorships and deep discounts but i don t put in the miles or wear and tear that i used to so the cyfac has lasted a long time after i realized that this was going to become a habit i stuck some felt furniture pads on the bottom so it wouldn t scuff the floor as she was dragging it good morning richard i say i have a particularly aromatic specimen for you it s from the land of your birth because clinical studies about the safety and efficacy of these products have not been submitted to fda consumers currently have no way of knowing please keep in mind it s going to look different on every screen lesson learned the peat burns brimming from their cups of stone so yesterday was mother s day in america every mother was able to sleep in get flowers gifts etc all praise be to allah he announced after the result yes indeed allah was by his side always on the watch for deviation keeping an eye out for any who dared to vote for another candidate if they did george the pseudo prophet warned they would have to face him on judgement day now when i see others with this kind of fundamental faith and belief in their religion i find it equal parts scary and admirable maintaining that kind of faith and devotion requires a surrender to an intense myopia that i can t even imagine it requires that you view the world in terms of absolutes black and white yes and no there is no room for shades of gray or maybes in a mind filled with the idea that there is only one path to heaven i already had the gift sack on the left assembled and ready to go you can read more about them in this post in that sack i packaged up some small candy bars an itunes card i had another bag of candy that i wanted to add and could have easily just tied this to the first sack with a ribbon but i decided to make the gift even more fun so i tucked the candies into the goodies sack on most birthdays i am reflective i look back on the past year and find fault in nearly everything i have done and promise not to make the same mistakes march 30 2012 and because the purse hangs down low i remove it and set it on the tiny ledge in the portapotty and turn around to well do my business but i want you to be wise about what is good we can talk about ideals standards morals and ethics but let s face it getting them 100 right every time is for future better policy and maybe even human evolution right now we need an understanding and resolution to the problem at hand should you or should you not reveal all the relevant data when it is yet to be published you want to share all your data with the peers but you also don t want to risk the full ownership of your work you don t want others to take your ideas and publish before you do but you also come to the meeting with the hope that you will gain from others ideas comments about your work the concern is even more acute when you like me come from a developing country where implementing the ideas can be slow for a variety of reasons i have heard people talking about sending an abstract to a meeting only when the manuscript is ready to be submitted is this the best we can come up with what about the data that is exciting but has not become a full story should you present a new method or a new transgenic animal you invented but you don t know what to do with it what if you had wonderful beginning in a project but you are not able to take it to the end point is it alright if others can take ideas from your work and take it to conclusion after all this will help science and the society eventually the band felt they were ready to make their way out to the west coast but first they needed to record some songs because you couldn t get a gig at the whisky a go go unless you had a record out so in 1979 they went to a studio called magic rat jerry counted his money as he walked in the door and then told the engineer to give them 120 worth sure enough eight songs got recorded that day a cow and a calf were captured to go velvet underground all tomorrow s parties us week of april 23 2012 thank you thank you thank you thank you make the sweet pastry crust as instructed here roll out to approximately 1 8 inch thickness line lightly buttered tartlet shells i lined 12 tiny shallow 2 ¼ inch wide molds in something like a cupcake tin 6 individual 2 ¾ inch wide tartlet molds for 18 tartelts in two sizes chill in the refrigerator while the oven preheats and the filling is prepared the way it works is that a very fine mesh is placed across the affected area in my case it would be the crown of my head and fibre extensions are then woven through the mesh to create the required look your real hair is then pulled through the mesh and intermingled with the extensions thus creating the illusion of a full head of hair and they insist that it doesn t damage your real hair even going as far to say that in some cases the existing hair base can see a vast improvement with 200 000 abortions a year we already have one of the highest rates in europe one of my friends describes this straight hair obsession best she says we live in hair prison and she is the this afternoon i went into my room which is the room closest to her yard and opened my blinds to see them putting up this fence on their side of the chainlink really then brenna came in and said the lady told her they were putting the fence up so jack wouldn t see her dogs and cry more wtf is her problem she has absolutely no empathy for a toddler my faith in the world is dropping let us stipulate here at the top i don t like black ipas i find the combo psychically disconcerting as if discovering that rush limbaugh suddenly became a peta loving vegan the mixture of black malts and clean crisp hopping confuse me never mind the syntactical dischord of a black pale and so while i m about to rave about this beer my opinion of the style hasn t changed i will not drink a lot of this beer in the future but that doesn t mean i can t appreciate and admire it however without the shelter of being able to say this is the right wrong place time for this life becomes a bit difficult to avoid living and things become difficult to avoid dealing with when they actually happen which is here and now and not at any other place or time that we have designated for it to occur to better suit us or so that we can avoid dealing with it at all possession has been glamorize by hollywood the exorcism is a reminder of how enthralled we can be over such things but it puts the emphasis on a man called a priest to free the girl from the demon and the emphasis should be on jesus only he can free someone who is controlled by demons yes he has given believers authority to cast out demons but it is only under his power that we can do so and you don t have to be a catholic priest to do so before the service had ended i left the church and as i emerged i was struck by two things first i found that i had no idea how long i had been inside it might have been only twenty minutes it might have been two hours i could not say i had been existing on a level at which clock time was unimportant secondly as i stepped out on the pavement the roar of the london traffic engulfed me all at once like a huge wave the sound must have been audible within the church but i had not noticed it i had been in another world where time and traffic had no meaning a world that was more real i would almost say more solid than that of twentieth century london to which i now abruptly returned on chores the cover was battered besides the main healing session i ll be doing regular unscheduled energy adjustments leading up to feb 3 for those who intend to join before the main session people can begin to notice effects of the energy adjustments soon after intending to join sensitive people can feel the effects of this adjustment period strongly before the main session here are comments from people who felt the energy working soon after intending to join be willing to make corrections i do this all the time i tend to be a tad opinionated but will be the given that it looked like no one in the entire apartment complex went to work today there was a great deal of traffic i don t know where they were all going but when i got to work the parking garage was unusually empty as well shop eat pray uh no shop and eat shop and eat we have a new religion the economy open 24 7 flash points across the state as the kinds of anomalies that some people go hunting for don t hint at improvements to good scientific theories but consist simply of any result which stands out in some way anything that looks a bit weird can be seen as an anomaly even though weirdness is often a fundamental and entirely expected feature of the universe not every theory should be expected to immediately explain every observation to suggest that a theory needs to be entirely thrown out and replaced with some entirely new paradigm is a common overreaction to one small anomaly being found a trick that myst once used to perform for matt and me he is now doing for our son ryan made the discovery using myst s toy mouse he s been obsessed with us playing catch with him using his football so he decided to try myst s catching skills thank you so much i m sorry you had to do that i say considering shaking his hand and then thinking better of it sh maintains that it is a nice looking lamp and i suppose that on its own it is it just doesn t match not that i am all matchy matchy but i do like a unifying theme and that theme usually isn t actually functions and will keep me from going blind or getting a headache for osu this period has been the last few years of poke basketball eddie sutton s descent into alcoholism prescription abuse and scowling disorder has been a difficult time for cowboy fans indeed the problem became so great that eddie had to resign from his head coaching post and pursue other activities campaigning for a strom thurmond national memorial drinking as much 3 beer as the human body will allow gambling in ok s many indian casinos okie noodling a bearmeat editor could speculate on such things for days regardless sutton s exit was hardly the triumphant farewell of ronald reagan or the graceful fade away of

following a bitter dispute between the two over the lawyer s refusal to stop writing a column for a newspaper owned by rupert murdoch and pull it off he did posterity hasn t been kind to maclaren ross depriving him off his deserved prominence in english literature but his work speaks for itself the collected memoirs contain a considerable range of topics anecdotes and incidents written in a variety of styles the highly literary childhood reminiscences in the weeping and the laughter with their evocative descriptions and vivid narrative syntax recall the work of vladimir nabokov they are full of brilliantly eccentric characters numerous idiosyncrasies acutely deadpan humour in fact these qualities pepper the memoirs throughout lackadaisical passages slowly unfold with droll interpositions and qualifications vibrantly recapturing the fears and fixations that define the lives of delicate children and then there is maclaren ross father the most important of the book s characters speaking of him in the coloured alphabet he recalls he discouraged even in wartime anything likely to promote hatred between nations and would not countenance the use of the term boche nor allow me to draw the kaiser s head on the shell of my breakfast egg and then smash it in with a spoon as other children did this attitude combined with his dislike of all militarism which as an ex officer wounded in the boer war he felt entitled to express whenever he liked was apt to be misunderstood when aired in public and led to his half strangling a man on a bus who accused him of being unpatriotic and pro german another character of note is maclaren ross nanny who was belgian and whom he called nanna we learn that she had an accent in speaking english not dissimilar from that of the french governess in uncle silas if what she said were phonetically rendered and though her disciplinary methods did not resemble those of this fictional prototype they were at the time quite severe enough to keep me in check she also had a moustache which prickled unpleasantly when she kissed me this did not happen often luckily as all demonstrations of affection were kept for public exhibition only in private our relations were on a strictly practical plain unbeknown to me however nanna s days with us were numbered it was a passion for atrocity stories that finally earned her the sack today is día de la memoria which marks the anniversary of the coup d état in 1976 that started the dictatorial rule of the proceso this seems like such a long time ago but yes it still is strongly in the memories of the people here and often crops up in the most unlikely places 4 i sulked today i have a post up over at the paper bakery sharing a fun little mother s day gift bag i made using the may add on kit which

persia she loved it and still loves baths we have a lot of pictures of her getting her bath like 429 almost but it was freaking adorable the ideal solution is not just to reflexively tug on the electronic umbilical cord but also while doing so to try to lend the client some perspective on the relative urgency of her issue relative not to all of the other cases the attorney is handling what could be more counterproductive than implying that you see this client s case as less significant than those of other clients but to the rest of what the client has in her life there will be times sure when a legal case will in fact be crucial to a client s immediate well being but for estate planners at least that is rare reassuring the client that you are taking her case seriously while subtly suggesting that because you are taking it seriously she can afford to step away from it for a while and live life is a humane and sensible way to foster both your own and your client s sanity

who are so dreary during the winter season a new beginning for many little critters out there gathering twigs and building nests singing all the while it s no different here at happy valley where as i

is happening have the british people at last started to grasp what is being done to them have they at last begun to realise that their politicians and most of their union leaders do not have their best interests at heart and have not had for decades does this mean that the penny has finally started to drop boyaa t r i b e it also reminds me of the great christmas pudding dilemma of 1992 christmas pudding a festive dessert tradition in these parts i cannot stand it not only does it contain the despicable sultana it is laden with many other dried fruit relatives necessity is the mother invention as they say and my mother was forced into inventing our version of the christmas pudding an ice cream pudding in the shape of a traditional pudding laden with bite sized pieces of chocolate bars and marshmallows drizzled chocolate on top to resemble custard she even put a little holly sprig on it needless to say it was an instant hit in our house and lived on through many more christmas

marathon in manchester 10 years ago when i completed halfway in a record breaking for me 1 55 and paid the price in the final third i knew i would slow down in the second half but did not anticipate how much the hills were taking out of me and how much my legs would hurt well today joseph rakofsky serves as a real life cautionary tale of why young lawyers should in fact be scared of ethical rules very scared joseph rakofsky s cornucopia of ethical blunders reads like an issue spotting exam in professional responsibility this is fine since i m not in my car that much just from getting to home

cheryl found herself to be axed from the show after a mere four days on the show dt cards now i m not saying anything about rangers fans in general it could have been any team it was the fact that he was so arrogant about me being a female hockey fan was what set me off the fact that he also asked if i was a puck slut really bothered me too my first gothy pair of boots were the lace up doc marten style way back in the late 90s at the time i played in a goth metal band with some friends i remember going to band practice all proud to show off my boots to the guys i thought they were so bad ass

and to lift our children s spirits began to help my own heart to seek hope ava and i dodged puddles as we moved down the block and as i looked ahead down the road i noticed them heart shaped rain puddles there were three of them in a row i smiled as i thought how like you father to send three little reminders on the path i am walking at this moment to remind me that i am truly loved truly treasured and remembered even during this time of emotional weariness god placed three puddles three heart shaped puddles in my path to remind me of his faithful love for me and my family i turned my

toby turner s literal version which is very funny he thinks the villain is actually smelling his sword which makes even less sense than kissing it i think i see his lips puckering a tiny bit so i vote

vibrational frequency patterns that you will experience or the range of duality that has been designed for that stage of development we call this the spectrum of light and shadows which has a balanced frequency range running through the center the vibrational frequencies increase with each higher sub dimensional level you achieve there is a range of frequencies created especially for the mental body another range for the emotional body and a more refined range for the etheric body that must be achieved before you may move to the next higher level as you move into a more refined vibrational frequency level a fragment of your higher self which is attuned to that level will take up residency within your soul star the higher self that has been your overlighting influence for the last phase of experience will move into your sacred heart chamber and merge with your soul self i left you on a sweet note in my previous post and a promise to photograph one of the 8 pound 4 kg easter eggs that

know that they cannot have the entire southern plains as a single province and respect the diversity within the region ethnic groups cannot expect to get special political rights for their communities in provinces where they are the single largest bloc at the cost of treating all other minorities as second class citizens this would violate all tenets of individual rights and indirectly strengthen the anti federal lobby well what are a group of adult nerds to do about this are we to go silently into our middle age and regretfully pack up our piles of shame resigning ourselves to a period our lives where the gaming is infrequent and mediocre no we must establish a plan to stake out our game time we must requisition basements and attics for our use others have their ritual trips to the bar and inviolate sunday sports sessions why cannot we gamers have our time so to that end my suggestions for how to address this issue there was the newly immigrant family who are receiving an incredibly high amount in housing benefit for a spacious extremely habitable looking flat in islington this panders to the prejudice we hear time and time again of immigrants jumping to the front of the housing queue and living in expensive properties to find real happiness a few other observations mainly of the crohn s and colitis foundation of america for one they gots corporate partners read into that

understand the why s there are also numerous ngos and other do gooders with their palms out for some of the free tax candy and of course it s in their best interests to keep aborigine affairs strained to keep the money rolling and until we drop this pc nonsense and stop the recognition of the first in the country with special rights then this issue will never go away australia and many other countries were conquered back in the day that s what countries did they conquered and no amount of trying to appease what happened will change history years from now they ll be looking at our pc

physiological level the man must inhale so he can exhale but there s also a special property of exhalation in that it tightens the muscles and prepares them to be used at the heart level the man relaxes and grounds himself in the humbling security of each drop but expresses that confidence in the reaching forward of the lift each side must give to the other and the more it gives the greater

willing to bet that teddy s mother wanted him to be a doctor or a lawyer just this week we had the privilege of speaking to dr clem price who is on the advisory board for the national museum of african american history and culture he talked about how they ve decided to tell a narrative that is common to all american people but do so through the lens of the african american it s not that i don t agree with the idea it just becomes a question of identity for me is this way of telling the african american story in the united states a concession to identity or is it trying to create a universal identity i m not sure i ll definitely be interested to see the museum when it opens all i know is that when the national museum of american history doesn t want to share the greensboro lunch counter with the national museum of african american history and culture there s definitely a larger question of identity at work so my answer to the question of identity identity is personal and

land simply yet another in a long line of democrat party cardboard cutouts who have repeated the same socialist boilerplate for fifty years only in a better suit and with better speech writers the stuff about turning back the rising tides and bringing peace brotherhood and a chicken in every pot was just the sort of thing you d expect a liberal politician to say his mantra of hope and change was simply a recycling of every political bromide ever uttered since the days of julius caesar barack obama i thought was always a creation of the media just someone with an interesting biography that

was an app called burbn that allowed people to check in different places and then share pictures and video of what you were doing they admit themselves it was a huge failure but what is most

district of tsim sha tsui i was adjusting the distance with my focus ring from time to time to get my shots the focus ring works when you know your distance with the subject that s about it fuji has to work on their focusing mechanism even the new x pro1 is suffering the same quirkiness i could only imagine one day fuji has a snap focus function like in ricoh no concrete reasons have been figured out yet but the authorities believe that it could possibly be a viral infection that may have killed the dolphins in huge numbers while environmental groups in the country blame the seismic oil exploration work carried out by bpz energy company for the dolphin deaths my electrologist thought it was interesting although she saw christen in the pictures i showed to her she also saw what she thought was a guy in the mode i presented to her when at her office although the logic here seems valid enough the conclusion is strange how can mike be liable for murder in case b when marge isn t dead after all murder requires an actual death doesn t it since the conclusion seems strange we might be inclined to think that at least one of the premises is dodgy but let s not be too hasty i suspect the reason for thinking that the conclusion is strange stems from confusing liability and responsibility this is something i ve spoken about before roughly liability is concerned with the price one has to pay for one s actions whereas responsibility is concerned with the outcomes that one actually brought about since this argument is framed in terms of liability not responsibility i think it makes sense mike must pay the same price in both cases because he controlled the same things despite the fact that his actions led to a different result i believe in this and it s been tested by research virginia tech did not violate federal law in its email response time that notified students of a shooting before a campus rampage that left 33 people dead the worst mass shooting by a gunman in u s history said an administrative judge s ruling reported by the los angeles times i work in the garden a lot when the weather s like this sometimes i ll spend all day digging in the dirt it s not a chore when the high is 82 f and it s nothing but clear skies i hope you ll check out the book or pass it along to friends and family who might need it and i really hope you ll start thinking about this stuff even though it s hard to do it s important in all the raids conducted by the prophet muhammad he was the one attacked if she knew anything about the koran and the sunna the key issue here is who decides what is just and good the tenth plague involved killing all firstborn egyptians where they all responsible for the enslavement of the israelites did they deserve their fate or were they collateral damage just so the pharaoh would get the message i m still standing and up up up cream the cream cheese and sugar together in a mixer add in the cool whip until combined

conference of women religious lcwr the leading organization of u s nuns seems to be dying down however make no mistake the story is not over the most important piece of it is yet to come how will the nuns respond to the vatican s congregation for the doctrine of the faith cdf decision to place an archbishop in charge of their conference in effect displacing the women s leadership of themselves borealis i am absolutely blown away by my lord there is some scriptures that the lord gave my wife many years ago before all this happened and has been fulfilled i am into what my kids are doing to a fault i am on their myspaces i have their passwords and i do check their phones they have to ask for permission to be on the computer and i have parental controls that limit what they can do i also check the browser history to see what sites they go on amazingly they don t seem to mind they ask for my help to do their backgrounds and we look at their friends statuses and pages together i have always told them they do not have a right to privacy over safety and that i care enough to know what they are doing is it enough heart a mess so the order of the day is books i d give a theme song to this presents me with some difficulty typically a book s plot or themes are more complex than any given song and as such the song can t necessarily represent the entirety of the book thematically at least not many songs i know have we mentioned i don t deal well with instrumental music i really have difficulty with musical comprehension without lyrics to grab hold of to ignore upper lower case distinctions use the i option i e type trivial pursuit the opening weekend box office of 10 2 million was the most ever for a nature documentary when you re picking your wedding date you have to consider your guests not every single one of them but talk to you key group immediate family on both sides and close friends if everyone lives in the same city town you re getting married in then a weekday wedding shouldn t be a real problem and it can save you money but a middle of the day weekday wedding can be difficult for people to get to get out of the ghetto blues i m interested to hear the current academic perspective on the issue and interested to see if the discussion goes outside of the typical dichotomous conversation on blood quantum i e one side saying it s good and the other it s bad clearly it s a lot more complicated the panelists all come from the academic world and there are two stanford affiliates go card so it ll be interesting to see how the conversation flows such dysfunctions become incorporated into the everyday culture of progressive organizations and as a result become invisible as if this weren t enough people who stay in the progressive movement adapt to these external dysfunctions by internalizing them one senior organizer told me that he trained young organizers the way he d been trained namely he threw them into tough situations to see if they d sink or swim never shown picture of collin finnerty why didn t resemble any of the descriptions the tale of helen s secret life with peter and also of her opinions on socialism were a true surprise to me and this book is so well written that sometimes i thought helen herself had done it and the author rosie sultan does an exceptional job of educating us and enticing us to learn more a book well

relieved because no snow occurred today i want you to remember one thing location location location it makes a big difference in meteorology another republican primary debate down another night of uninteresting hackery the more i pay attention to the republican debates the more i become convinced that president obama is likely to run away with this election even if the republicans happen to do the smart thing and nominate mitten at their candidate silly cow robert newton cyril cusack the colour palette is a little scary for me but i think i like it several tableaus formed the part of the procession the first tableau showed jesus in a garden with his disciples the second tableau showed jesus carrying the cross while the third was based on crucifixion of jesus christ the fourth tableau exhibited the grave of jesus christ guarded by four roman soldiers while the fifth depicted the victory over death by resurrection of jesus christ for which easter is celebrated the sixth tableau

i was called sexy by a hot man who had muscles for days which only bolstered my belief that everything was going well now looking at the disciples we can see that they have gone beyond this stage of

original destination mars also to further expand upon my embarrassingly low maintenance read cheap habits i had only ever had a manicure once prior to getting one on saturday so i really wasn t expecting much i don t like manicures because i generally don t like people prodding at my cuticles and other sensitive bits but what s more i don t see the point in them they usually only last a few days at most without chipping so why not just do your own nails well i m happy to say that the manicure i got on saturday was pretty awesome they were by orly and i think they re called gel fx manicures but anyway the end result is literally chip proof it feels like i have a super shiny protective gel shell over my nails and the results are supposed to last like 2 weeks whhhattt my daughter and i in the woods gathered on wednesday i commented that the morning star published an article on welsh politics that was more incisive than anything you would find in the western mail nowadays to

based on your interests and likes and i would love to share with you more of my faves so please give this cake a try it got rave reviews on epicurious com so i knew it would be a winner i took note of the remarks about too much butter and sugar for the topping so i cut down the amounts by half and i m glad i did this revised amount is perfect when you re enjoying some time off or running errands having a gunman literally cross your path isn t on the list of things to do every kids reacts differently and in some cases the subsequent damage is not able to be seen so when i hear the words well my child has all their vaccines and is fine i cringe just a little just because your child is strong enough lucky enough or not damaged to a visible degree does not in any way prove that vaccines are safe you could take a bottle of sleeping pills and die i could do the same and live on your terms it would be concluded therefore it is completely safe to take a bottle of pills no side effects

it was written a lot longer and a lot larger laughs it was a written with titanic like corridors of vomit but it was a low budget film so we ended up doing a parody of the harrison ford film raiders of the lost ark with the ball of vomit it was actually a lot funnier despite the traditional feel this is high concept horror from simon and well worthy of inclusion in any year s best collection for many years i had a black and white picture of picasso on the refrigerator he was sitting at his table with bread made into hand shapes some friends who were not educated in art asked if this was my

italian and jewish communities was confiscated the ancient qur anic law of cutting off the hands of thieves was reinstituted gambling and alcoholic beverages were outlawed and all foreign petroleum assets were nationalized 1973 a fervent arab nationalist he sought to unify libya with other arab countries including egypt and tunisia while bitterly opposing israel since gadhafi took power the libyan government has been known for its support of many international terrorist and guerrilla organizations including the irish republican army the palestine liberation organization plo and other

imagine a world before air travel before the panama canal when getting cargo or passengers from one ocean to another required a voyage through the southern seas the route from atlantic to pacific involved a trip through the straits of magellan a narrow channel between the mainland of south america and tierra del fuego the straits were protected from the harsh conditions of the open ocean but still subject to bad whether powerful and unpredictable currents and shallow reefs the other day he showed me his summersaults in the water he decided to try a back summersault at first it just wouldn t work a minute later he had it two minutes later he was doing three in a row and his handstands in the water are pretty good he can only swim about 10 feet so far but i won t be surprised if he s swimming the length of the pool in a few weeks or maybe it will take a few years like all the other big advances i never can predict 2 decide on a design this required first deciding on what type of flowers we were using as i really wanted it all to gel this also required endless nights spent in front of my computer on invitation sites searching for the perfect one which i didn t find which is exactly when my wonderfully talented sister came on the scene to create this invitation rsvp post card which raises the question am i writer because i was so often an outsider or was i an outsider

became popular in the 1950s as a way to hold food and beverage items while watching tv the iconic item being a tv dinner national advertising for tv tray tables first appeared in 1952 a full year before swanson introduced the tv dinner in october 1953 tray tables are portable easy to use quickly tucked away and the perfect solution to needing just a bit of tabletop whenever you need it a few years ago i was at a liturgy in a small unfamiliar parish in another part of the state as usual i did my best not to sing so loudly that i stuck out from the rest of the congregation but i still sang as clearly as i usually do processing to communion we were singing you are mine to which of course i know all the words and the young man in front of me a few steps from the communion station turned around and whispered nice job the bad boys of saloons happens from 3 00 pm to 4 30 pm july 21 in the queen anne ballroom at the hotel monteleone go here to purchase tickets i find the whole i was just

being pretty then you really are a sad sad case the jamaican black strap is not a scary drink you may or may not believe me depending on your view of the two primary ingredients molasses and jamaican rum i happen to love jamaican rum this fact alone would have floored mr baker who many times asserts that most ladies have a strong dislike for the stronger more pungent jamaican rums i do not particularly disagree with his assertion indeed some women probably would find the funkier rums a bit too um well funky for their liking i would add however that as with most things this fact does not apply to women alone leaving bold statements about gender stereotyping aside why is jamaican rum so challenging the easy answer it comes down to production to the warm kitchen i want to say my deepest regret for not having be able to post daily oracle or tarot readings for the last couple of days due to the fact that i was hospitalized as i climbed back into the trek to drive away i stared at the piece of wood we had been using for a chock for thousands of miles would we never get to throw that darn thing into a campfire i m a sucker for movies that say they re gonna break down relationships and show all the little ticks and foibles from he s just not that into you to why did i get married i ll be front and center soaking it all in but with think like a man instead of my usual bits of i hear that or yep girls haven t we all been there bonding i laughed my butt off never have i been so entertained by what many have labeled a chick flick this isn t a chick movie this isn t a dude movie this isn t an urban movie a label i dislike as if entertainment can and should be separated by any lines in the sand this is a fun enjoyable film that everyone can enjoy well maybe not the kids they d

exhibition at the time feature donna wilson who created this knitted scene i like how childish and stylised it is it felt really welcoming and fun however i did feel like it was a product stand as later in the trip i noticed that some of the items were present in the store it no longer felt like she crafted her work specifically to express an idea but just to gain a bit of cash interestingly

summer take a minute and decide on what festival they re attending or is it with glastonbury and oxegen taking a year off and sonisphere joining the big chill in being cancelled have you decided against festivals this year can your purse wallet not take the punishment or perish the thought is it your body that cannot hack the 3 5 days or so of absolute annihilation that you put it through if any of these reasons are ringing any bells then you may be in the population of regular festival goers that have bowed out this year only to be followed by the festivals themselves 20 human hair is

task at hand and forget all the stressors in your daily life the answer to that question is rather complicated when photons hit the cells of the retina they activate a chain action rather like a domino effect the first of these domino pieces is a molecule called 11 cis retinal that is sensitive to photons when struck by a photon this molecule changes shape which in turn changes the shape of a protein called rhodopsin to which it is tightly bound rhodopsin then takes a form that enables it to stick to another resident protein in the cell called transducin redemptions will be less than

most of stephen king s works i enjoyed it and it moved quickly despite its millenary page count i really like how he populated a town and then forced them to remain together through the plot device very interesting dynamics now some of his characters were larger than life and a little hard to believe but that was acceptable the only thing that persistently bothered me during my romp through this tome was the timing the degeneration of the town took place not over months or even weeks but days i guess i just have a little more faith in humanity than that to me the work would have been strengthened if the time frame had been expanded there were also some silly little supernatural things which occurred that felt out of place mostly involving a dog and there was one very postmodern chapter that was really out of place in it a disembodied narrator appeared and flew through the town describing everything that was happening in a summary fashion it was weird came out of nowhere and disappeared just as quickly you have to wonder if it just got missed by an editor all in all though i think this was one of his better books and his characteristic exploration of character and setting

generally speaking we are quick to criticize and complain more often than not we are not willing to go the next step and think of practical realistic solutions so if you have an issue with how things are communicated between people change how you personally communicate take the steps in your own personal life that you want others to be instituting this is huge once you begin modeling it for people then they expect that from you in the future they may also begin reciprocating the changes back to you so basically all that lindsay had to do was have her overworked attorney file a quick appeal

arguments levelled against american media cultural imperialism dating back to the 1960s and 1970s frequently ignored how international audiences responded to or appropriated american media content since the late 1970s and early 1980s this academic oversight has been substantially redressed through the emergence of cultural studies particularly as practised and popularised in the uk as an academic discipline yet while cultural studies has paid considerable attention to national and international audience responses to popular music television and cinema practitioners in this field have historically shown comparatively less interest in popular print culture such as magazines paperback novels fan publications or comic books and their readerships while this trend has undergone a welcome albeit gradual reversal studies of comic book reading practices and of comic book readers and collectors remain relatively few there does however seem to be more activity in this area concerning the reception of japanese manga and anime and its regional asian equivalents amongst western audiences this study of international fan communities of the phantom will i hope add new insights to current academic thinking and knowledge about comic books and their audiences all this new blogger initiative stuff has reminded me of one of the common pithy bits of supposed wisdom that i ve heard since junior high when inspirational speakers try to tell us good little empty headed starry eyed students what to do with our lives and careers perhaps you ve heard this one before i was thinking about all of this as i stepped outside this morning feeling the strange coolness in the air the dew under my bare feet in the grass the peppery scent of the muscadines ripening on the vines as i reached out and touched a purple flower springing from the weeds in our garden i felt a strange calm pass through me i listened as a prayer formed in my brain all by itself this book is not a stand alone novel so you will have to read the other novels to get the full story what zaina is saving the world from is not uncovered in this first book nor are the specifics of the prophecy

results are well worth the mental embarrassment at first mr wilson in reply said that 1 977 was the whole sum which this picture would cost with the exception of 2 2s 2d paid for its carriage from paris all other expenses were paid by the seller the purchase of the picture was recommended solely by the director of the national gallery but was acquiesced in and decided upon by the trustees whatever difference of opinion there might be as to the value of the picture there could he thought be none as to its authenticity for it stood in the position of being perhaps the best authenticated picture of the kind in the world in venice where the picture had remained from the time of its being painted up to a very recent date it was well known to have been the production of paolo veronese and besides that it was mentioned as his work and as belonging to the church from which it had been taken in a book which was published in 1581 eight years after the date at which it was painted and seven years before the death of the artist in the british museum there was a print of the picture which was engraved in the year 1649 i m excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and my heart is full groundwater is drawn from aquifers there are two types of aquifers an operator needs to be aware of an unconfined aquifer and a confined aquifer an unconfined aquifer is an aquifer that is

confined aquifer is also called an artesian aquifer a little like jo walton s mor who picks up i capture the castle thinking it s about medieval siege strategy but finds a delightful novel instead i

get what i was looking for i got what i wanted jennifer stob yale university i ve always been interested in wwii history i was excited to hear there was a movie about the tuskegee airmen i must admit i found by accident whilst wandering around the internet i am pretty much out of touch with current pop culture the water is so piping hot i remember worrying about what to do with the whole santa thing a couple years back i remember not wanting to yank it out of christmas traditions completely but wanting to focus this holiday mostly on christ i guess i felt like lots of kids these days expect huge presents or tons of little ones and are disappointed when they don t get what they want i remember thinking i don t want my kids to be like that to be entitled as we the future generations are starting to be i didn t want them to care about all the gifts that they get so much as they care about what this holiday is about of course all kids are excited to get presents on christmas morning but i want them to know that it s okay if it s nothing fancy or huge whether or not we can afford a big christmas or not it s okay to keep christmas simple and still get fun exciting presents because christmas is about as she put it her self a real person jesus i was also thinking about how some people play up the whole santa thing so much and try to have their kids believe in him for as long as possible and that s fine i don t think it s a bad thing but i do feel bad for the kids that some day they will be totally disappointing that he is not real i think e will be okay with it and she won t be devastated especially after that little conversation i heard and that s good i m glad it won t rip her heart out yes mom didn t you know there was an earthquake and a tsunami and a whole bunch of people got killed everyone was talking about it at school everyone knew about it except for me why don t you ever tell me about this stuff why don t you ever tell me anything care for the queen red

you can add whatever sauce you like it s too darn bad that the mid 1940 s midnight was such a bland character he had little personality no super powers and lacked the grim drive for vengeance that

stories about a tenth as fun to read as his plastic man series last but not least i will be going to lunch tomorrow with leanne from spend a day in second grade i am very excited to meet her in person she actually teaches at an elementary school i attended when i was younger i will of course have pictures to share we all know of grand human projects that never came to fruition sometimes there is

body chemistry i was vegan for years and recently i added free range chicken and wild salmon universal black and white mandates for all is short sighted i lost some weight eating just veggies fruit

number of project companies in the people s republic of china seeing that we set the tone this morning on the topic of prayer here are my thoughts on prayer things that i ve been taught we had 67 yogis for the weekend and 43 who stayed on for the whole week it takes a special kind of maniac to sit for a week of silent practice i have to say this was an inspiring collection of maniacs that s it my cubicle calls that s what surprised me most about this book the underage drinking getting into clubs on false ids spiked drinks knife crime alcoholism yes all this goes on in real life yes i guess all kids of the target audience range will be aware to a greater or lesser extent of all this but i was surprised these things make it into books aimed at teens that s why i said i realise now i didn t know what ya fiction really was when i was that age there was no such genre when you grew out of enid blyton and arthur ransome you read your mum s catherine cooksons and shirley conrans or your dad s arthur c clarks well that s what i did anyway it was that or my brother s commando comics a partial meltdown means that portions of fuel rods were above water long enough to melt some of the upper sections resulting in at least some significant amount of fuel falling to the bottom of the pressure vessel s in such random regrouping of fuel at the bottom of a pressure vessel the resulting unstructured masses of fuel are potentially able to emit significant amounts of fission products they might emit a lot or they might emit relatively less depending on their random new geometry but since it is unknown how much fuel has melted down we can say little that is definite except that the amounts of fission products resulting that have been created and will be created are unpredictable and a significant portion of these radioactive products escaped from the cores are likely in water and water leaks while some escaped during the steam venting can you come over this weekend to help me pack a copy of the first comic to feature caped hero superman has been sold on the internet for 1m 646 000 bookslept she s it s a little bit lumpy here and there not that there s something wrong with lumpiness but i think for a first try it s pretty good i may make tutorials of these two displays later on gutters and sewers i like all kinds of salsas whether they are raw cooked fruit based or tomatillo of course the fresher the ingredients the better but my all time favorite salsa is a cooked salsa whether for nostalgic reasons or for the fact that cooked salsas are in fact complex sauces they are my favorite although i ve tinkered with my dad s recipe adding different ingredients and modifying the cooking technique i rarely stray from my favorite ingredients tomatoes green chiles anaheim most often green onions and cilantro even without jalapeños you can make a great salsa with just those ingredients i had prepared this post last night so it was ready to go early this morning then when i got up this morning i saw that the idea of this card could also work for today s splitcoast clean and simple challenge which includes a sketch by taylor whom you have already seen on this hop so i made a second card for you that showcases a different sentiment unfortunately it belated occurred to me that i should also have used a different silhouette for you to see with sub zero winds rushing in from the steppes and a cold snap across most of europe i can t think of a better way to cram in some comfort food and liquid central heating get yourself over to this site for authentic russian recipes she and her brother founded a handbag brand meridian 110 she told me about her new business and i offered her to take photos of her new line i m an amateur photographer but i do love styling so i offered my unskilled photography and styling to her as a friend once again the difficulties of animating enough action to match the scripts came to the fore the problem partially lies in recording the voice over separately rather than straight onto the animation but this isn t really practical however i think that any problems like this teach the pupils a lot and they hopefully will be very aware of the issue for future animations what do i believe is the meaning of life this week sophia found a youtube video on how to transform an old t shirt into a totally new shirt she took one of alexander s t shirts that was too small for him and created an updated teen look for herself she is also busy reading a few different books she is on vacation from dog sitting this week which means she gets to sleep in a little later she spends time online with friends through facebook and skype and also in person through homeschool groups or separate outings she bought a ukulele and is learning to play that as well as continuing to take guitar lessons with her dad best thing for me that she does everyday is gives me lots of hugs but the slasher film per se doesn t do much for me blood for the sake of blood eh the first friday had enough other things to keep me interested the characters were actually a little character y it s always fun to watch the back story unwind even when you already know it and honestly the setting is quite gorgeous this really was one of the things working against the scare value of the movie for me i grew up somewhere that looks very much like crystal lake and while i ve seen plenty of horror movies with a woods y setting that work just dandy to set my adrenaline going this wasn t one of them there wasn t a nasty vibe coming out of those trees at least to my mind a day to remember all who have served us and are currently serving us in the armed forces of the united states of america this day was instituted to honor and remember the participants in our own civil war where over 600 000 lives were lost today we continue to find cause to send our young men and women into harms way to defend the freedoms we have come to appreciate here in the u s what we should be really be doing is mourning the passing of a once great nation sold out to the values and standards of the third world by a motley collection of treacherous politicians far left extremists and their woefully ignorant useful idiot liberal allies remember the sound of the second plane full of people roaring in so very low and the explosive smack as it hit remember that split second when you and i and everyone across the country realized as one this was no accident if the ny mq were to occur would you stay faithful to your god and blame the destruction on bloomberg his tribe and mammon so i m really hoping that the homestudy will be complete within 2 weeks pray hard friends family well i hope you enjoyed this monday s showcase and don t forget to

runs off whining about how everyone likes the charismatic courageous visionary leader gai more than him and then he bumps into ayase and has a tender moment of character development with her whose attentions you ll quickly spurn if you have some good quotes or how to s or a special ad for your book then go ahead and tweet but not many people certainly not me are going to buy your book just because they now know that you change your child s diaper three times a day thankfully once i put my time into these projects especially 1 and 5 the percentages will change one time at band camp i went to take a drink of my soda and there was an ant on it and it got in my mouth and it tasted really really nasty that s what ants do they have this substance called formic acid that they produce just so they taste blechh i do not believe that covering them in chocolate would help the panelists will include culinary historians andrew coe and annie hauck lawson and co founder of the brooklyn flea jonathan butler who is also publisher of the popular brownstoner web site which posts many wonderful articles on brooklyn s architectural history john now said that it was interesting that we hadn t really mentioned beloved up to now although she was in many ways the focus of the novel this wasn t really picked up for further discussion though i think in retrospect she s a kind of medium in the terms of the novel for the conveyance of the past into the present of the novel there was some discussion as to whether she was a real ghost or not she finally materialises as the eighteen year old woman she would have been had she lived and twice there is reference to the rumour of a young woman kept as a sex slave having escaped from a shed nearby but our conclusion was that we were not meant to read the novel in these either or realist terms but to inhabit the mentality of the characters and their attitudes to an ambiguous spirit world some people ann in particular wondered how differently americans to whom this history of slavery belonged might read the novel ann said that in the podcast morrison states that she made the decision to address her novel to black people unlike the white abolitionist harriet beecher stowe for instance whose uncle tom s cabin had been addressed to white readers although it seems to me that her technique of retrospective revelation is employed on ignorant white readers most usefully of all it seems like everything is hard right now taking care of the boys effectively taking care of the house taking care of everything at work waking up in

in black stazon the balloon and small elements were stamped onto the off cut centre piece cut out and everything shrunk in this the first part i ll be covering the first step and sometimes the hardest figuring out what to do to the item of clothing so all of this in a very roundabout way brings me to an exciting piece of news i want to share that i recently signed to publish two books with mira the first evidence of life will come out in april of 2013 and the second in march of 2014 i am thrilled of course i wanted to express my gratitude to my wonderful agent barbara poelle i looked it up and found a bouquet of full bloom roses is significant of gratitude and so i sent her exactly that i could have sent only pale pink roses or wood sorrel to convey joy or gooseberries for anticipation the

our door with cherries from his garden this year because of the exceptionally hot spring he s turned up a little earlier than usual and with more cherries than ever before by the time we set sail and the ocean rippled and rocked our small boat i was having tiny second thoughts whale sharks are the biggest fish on earth averaging 41 50 feet and 47 000 pounds maybe it wasn t such a good idea to get

this mistrust led to many problems but it is the subsequent misunderstanding of human dominion over creation that i want to focus on this morning rejecting the divine order resulted in the mistaken belief that humanity s dominion over creation means we can act however we choose in relation to the world this perspective interprets dominion as domination and exploitation which has been most clearly manifested in the way humanity has chosen to use the world s resources let me explain by way of illustration here i stand damp and peeling giggles and funny faces enough so to warrant picture

here in south africa are experiencing extremely hot temperatures but before examining the parameters it is worth looking at what these parameters represent the cbi has produced what it calls baseline and adverse parameters and its press release says my emphasis stress testing is used by banking supervisors to determine whether a bank is adequately capitalised to withstand adverse macro economic events or unanticipated shocks it is not an economic forecast it employs hypothetical scenarios whilst it is understandable that the adverse scenario is not a forecast i would have expected the baseline scenario to indeed be a forecast the press release from the cbi is woefully brief but if we go back to the now discredited committee of european banking supervisors cebs stress tests last summer we see that what they referred to as the benchmark scenario was indeed a forecast lifted from the eu commission autumn 2009 forecast and the european commission interim forecast in february 2010 with several adaptations to reflect recent macro economic developments in a number of countries the adverse scenario was internally generated by the cebs so contrary to what the cbi says it does indeed appear that the baseline scenario in the present tests is a forecast i stand to be corrected on this and have asked the cbi for clarification according to an article in an old newspaper ada was involved in the local school it was about the controversy of allowing five japanese children to attend the public school some of the eau gallie citizens obviously didn t want them there they should have their own school they cried ada voted to allow these five children to attend school with her son i am so proud of my great grandmother and her decision to vote yes so much fun for you and your

but i don t care as everyone gobbles it up i don t know why it happened that on this occasion i was more than ever struck with that queer air of sociability of the cousinship and family life which

judge the strength of a series by its premiere episode with american programs pilots are generally the first aired and they usually suck even if they re good they pale in comparison with the rest of

keith waterhouse called jeffrey bernard is unwell the play concerns the reminiscences of jeffrey as he sits accidently locked into his local pub all night featuring peter o toole at the time it was both hilarious and moving and was also noted for the fabulous egg and pint trick as a piece of stage business do look it up and try it yourself but wear some waterproofs jeffrey was a columnist for the spectator magazine and the title of the play comes from the habit of his employers of posting jeffrey bernard is unwell in the blank space where his sporadic column would have appeared had he not

years i continued to try venison in various forms but it wasn t until i was in my early thirties that i really developed a love for it one of my favorite preparations using venison is chili i actually think chili tastes better with venison than it does with any other type of meat i am given a great deal of venison meat each year so i am always trying to come up with different ways to make it so we don t get bored eating the same old thing over and over again i have hit on a couple really great flavor combinations using venison which i will share with all of you in future posts for now lets start with a truly delicious recipe for venison chili of course if you are unable to get any venison you may substitute any meat of your choosing some installments of slummin it take place almost by

installment i knew had to happen as soon as i saw an advertisement for the sandwich after all it s not every day that one of the major players in fast food tries their hand at guacamole going in i figured i had this sandwich pegged i was ready to come back here and holler about a crime against avocados about know nothing eggheads overstepping their homogenized corporate world but honestly the sandwich could have been a lot worse the guacamole is loose and smooth a far cry from the many kinds of guacamole we all know and love but in the grand scheme of processed avocado product it was one of the better ones i ve come across it had a bright strong avocado flavor and while the texture wasn t ideal it isn t like i haven t run across smooth guacamole at plenty of taquerias the sandwich includes both cheese and mayonnaise which given the avocado really aren t necessary that said they don t interfere too much and all you can really taste is the chicken the avocado and the bacon the

most sold book of all time it is regularly on various best seller lists i have to say i was a bit sceptical about the whole vampire thing at first visions of buffy and countless other camp vamps sprang to mind but true blood has adopted a really cool angle it s set in the fictional town of bon temps in louisiana where two years ago thanks to the invention of synthetic blood called tru blood which is sold in all the local bars and convenience stores and comes in delicious a b ab and o flavours vampires came out of the coffin and are now trying to integrate in the community alongside the living residents some locals have welcomed the vampires whilst others are very hostile and want to rid the town of their newly acquired neighbours it was while i was prison that i first became acquainted with the aces study aces is an acronym for adverse childhood experiences study adverse childhood experiences are simply put traumatic experience which occurred before the age of 18 what i learned was among my fellow female inmates nearly 100 of these women had an aces score of over 6 with 10 being the highest possible score statistics on women in prison who have suffered childhood abuse and trauma are generally quoted at being of 60 to 90 i tend to believe the 90 since women in prison are almost always there for drug and alcohol related crimes what does this tell us it tell me that these women myself included we not born flawed nor defective nor are we merely addictive personalities we are women who have been hurt and hurt again and then hurt some more and we coped with that pain the best way we knew how as faulty and personally destructive as was that coping mechanism of course when we are drinking or drugging we are a perfect candidate for an abuser looking for an easy target to prey on and the cycle continues and gets worse how has the e version of the novel fared 30 fear the ventures but recently i just become friend with the person that came up with the name doesn t that just sound amazing i wish my school had had a program like that when i was in 4th grade or ever i think it s such a valuable experience for the kids to get that much hands on learning from professionals in the field of writing and publishing and to have the opportunity to create and display their own work they come away from the experience feeling that writing and illustrating are possibilities not just pipe dreams and that has to be a boost to their creative spirits well we ve all seen the news stories it has come to my attention that some police departments are in the preliminary stages of deploying drones domestically on the surface if i can begin with an appropriately aquatic metaphor the people of the sea is a work of non fiction a journal kept by one man recording his experiences travelling through ireland and the farthest islands of scotland but unlike heinrich böll s irish journal a book which has also quite rightly been reprinted many times david thomson s interest in talking to the locals the crofters fishermen and travellers was not to produce some kind of tourist guide but to document for posterity the stories that have been passed down orally from generation to generation specifically those concerning the selkies selkie being the word for seal in the orcadian dialect thomson was not a naturalist or even a conservationist that was not where his interest stemmed at the time of writing the people of the sea he was employed by the bbc as a writer and producer of radio documentaries a post he held between 1943 and1969 the writing of the book might have been facilitated by the fact that many of the programmes he worked on were to do with natural history but his personal fascination with seals dates back to the time when aged eleven he sustained an eye injury playing rugby which nearly blinded him and unable to continue his schooling in london he was packed off to tigh na rosen the home of his maternal grandmother in nairn an ancient fishing port and market town close to inverness in scotland this would have been circa 1925 but it was not his first trip there that would have been when he was five along accompanied by his parents and sisters 3 when i was a little girl i wanted to be a boy why partially because they were always going on cool campouts for scouts but mostly it was because they got to buzz their hair

got to the business of furnishing decorating and adjusting it to our needs what we left for last like any sane persons were putting up pictures while this may seem reasonable enough and living without pictures for three months not a big deal believe me it was because the previous occupant had drilled holes in every single freaking wall which were not painted over he only used a greyish kind of substance to cover them that only made them more visible and while this was not such a big problem for most walls which hold 2 to 3 holes arranged symetrically one of our living room walls has a grand total of 9 holes splattered across it in no recognizable pattern except maybe of a leviathan they look as if a blind man had been drilling for fun in the dark which is probably rather close to the

enough but he comes running after me freaking out asking me whats wrong over and over he looked like he cared but it made me wonder if maybe he was just concerned that i had found something else on his computer or caught him in something i realized me running away wasnt going to solve anything so i walked back to the apartment walked past his open arms i was still full of anger towards him after what he said im fucking pregnant is all i could say as i walked past him into our apartment before collapsing onto the floor crying again again i was happy but more so afraid of what was going to

manhood and ownership takes control over us it triggers our brains to get ready to become the provider that we are meant to be it may take him a few days or even a week to get his brain together but be there with him as he will be there for you and talk to him about everything you are thinking as far as theabout your future together if you are worried about the money and all that keep this in mind the military always looks out for family they will help with medical for you and the baby housing etc also if you do decide to work together on this and the military does help you guys out they will also do this in the event he gets deployed as long as you are living together and have proof that he is the father paternity test my advice for living together is to discuss moving in to basic

have loved discussing my affection and admiration for green day while at concerts i will usually interact with other fans discussing their past albums side projects such as the foxboro hot tubes and describe how we were first introduced to the band after a while i noticed a pattern amongst the older fans who were introduced to green day prior to american idiot and 21st century breakdown which i like to call the dookie situation the reason i call it the dookie situation is because most diehard green day fans categorize people into two categories 1 fans of green day before dookie and 2 fans of green day after dookie basically their argument is always were you a fan before or after they found mainstream success my counterargument has and will always be i discovered green day because of that album what s wrong with that that s usually fine but if they have an attitude i add excuse me if i was only in the third grade when it came out and weren t able to check them out in the east bay in

jenna lyons however is a different story entirely not just because i love j crew and proenza s bags are perfection but because the whole outfit is perfection neon is intense and neon on neon isn t the way to go the way to pull off neon is to let it be the statement piece of the outfit when the neon is competing for attention with everything else you re wearing that s when it goes wrong forget all

friday i think the hardest week of the year is the first week of the year typically people are worried about resolutions not eating certain things coming back from vacation if they used all their benefits for the fiscal year the list could just go on and on for my family and friends we are usually beginning a consecration so on january 1st we are worried about making sure we get all our favorite terrible foods in before we start the fast january 2nd 4th we worry if we can make it on water for the first three days of the fast no matter what it is you stress about week one of january is always somewhat stressful preheat the broiler wash asparagus and snap off bottoms of stems arrange asparagus on baking sheet in a single layer lightly drizzle with olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper summertime we went berry picking we would walk in a little path to the upper end of the island blackberries would be the first to get ripe we got lots of them to keep mother going making cakes and puddings after that it would be raspberries red currants and blueberries enough to keep us busy all summer mother would go to the marshes to pick bakeapples and bottle them they were delicious for desserts lasting all through the winter when i got older i joined up with a crowd and we would row over to the main shore to pick bakeapples we would be gone all day especially if they were plentiful we would light a fire and boil the kettle on the beach and sit down for a big feed of smoked salmon and homemade bread some people on the island had smokehouses and smoked salmon all summer long we enjoyed our trip and our feeds making sure we got home before dark i remember the first trip i had away from home my mother took us up to glovertown on the steamer it was at night and as we were coming up the bay a little bird flew down in the cabin that caused quite a bit of excitement mail was carried by the steamer both in newfoundland and labrador to send a letter to someone on the labrador it had to be addressed to the person name the schooner in care of labrador afloat if they chanced to connect with the steamer they got their mail but if not they would be gone all summer without a word from home if there were a death at home the steamer would raise a black flag if there were a telegram for anyone on our island a flag would be raised on a pole at fair island someone would go up in boat to get the message often it wasn t for the person who went for the message but there was much co operation among the people the mail boat brought our mail and we loved to see it coming in the harbour to get the train we would go by passenger boat to gambo to connect with it my first trip on the train was when i was about twelve years old my mother went to fair island with me where we met with caleb ackerman who was going through on the train i was going to glovertown so she put me in his care all my teenage years i spent away from home the first summer i spent at traytown with uncle john and aunt florence littlejohn aunt florence s family were all grown so she wrote mother and asked her to let me come and spend the summer with her the following summer i came back to traytown to work with the kean family when i was fifteen i went to glovertown to work with aunt jane holloway she had four sons at home but was unable to work she was a dear lady and each day would manage to get downstairs and sit in her chair she showed me what to do i would wash cook and clean for them people were so limited in those days with no jobs and very little money i remember i got five dollars and bought myself a nice grey coat i was so pleased with it and later got enough to buy a pair of white sneakers aunt jane taught me how to card and spin sheep s wool i knitted socks for the boys that benefited me much in years to come the next time i left home it was with my parents they moved up to lockyer s bay to cut logs i spent one night with them the next day i went to hare bay and got a job with percy and nellie wells who owned a business and took boarders i earned five dollars a month i stayed for six months and went home in the spring transportation from hare bay wasn t easy i knew the matthews brothers were at trinity building their schooner and would be going to the island on the weekend i decided to go trinity and go home with them there i met walter matthews who became my boyfriend and later my husband later that spring i made up my mind to do something i never thought i could do because i didn t like being on the water i was always seasick most of all i feel danish denmark is where i live where my friends live and i know my city far better than any other cities and i love it here when i m working away from home it s easy to forget all that it s easy to walk in the front door and see i m a big blue giants fan but there s no doubt the roaring jets own the buzz right now that s cool with me no insecurities here i ve heard it said this is a jets town now uh no they may own the day but this is still a giants town no knock on the jets but they ve taken major strides under woody johnson that were not taken under leon hess so all being well trullo

it to a rectangle of marina mist cs and attached 2 brown metal su brads while i used cherry cobbler cs for the card base i added a second layer with some su dsp from their frostwood lodge collection after mounting some early espresso quilted ribbon across it i also cut out a white shimmer paper snowflake and added a light blue snowflake brad to tie it all together the white shimmer paper is from doodlebug designs and i have no idea where i got the blue snowflake brad sorry so i m a fighter which is a decent quality and i ve got this really great yes team i find these two things are very necessary components when going after the truly and ridiculously difficult artistic pursuits i m after forget artistic pursuits these are some of the necessary qualities to cut through the bullsh t of

the fellows found schools where the expectations ranged from strict and inflexible to almost lackadaisical in their approach every question on a homework assignment might be checked for accuracy or just skimmed to see whether it was completed missing work might be a zero or not count at all toward the class grade and now for the much anticipated results my scan looked good my thyroglobulin level was 1 1 0 no evidence of cancer but since it s headed in the right direction and the radiation takes a full six months to work we are hoping that in three months from now it will be 0 it is such a relief to at last have some good news my doctor was shocked by how good the results were this soon and i honestly believe that my focus on diet and healing has a lot to do with the impressive amount of cancer fighting that has occurred in my body the other thing that black racists do when a white gets suckerpunched and attacked by other racist cowardly blacks is say he deserved it then in a snap

wasn t sure if i wanted to write this post or not it has been a hard time but i decided to do it because maybe just maybe it will help someone else being in pain and ill and it my case looking like a zombie with my millions of rashes and not knowing what is causing it is horrible the unknown and what ifs will drive you mad the despare and the selfishness none of it is good and yet it is all real when we aren t feeling well we can t focus on others it affects so much of our lives not only physically but mentally and especially emotionally i have not only suffered because of all this but most especially my little family 1 a few years ago i had some interest in high points the highest points of elevation in a defined area like a county state or country there are some people who make it their goal to hike to the high point in all 50 states easy to do in the east but not so easy in the western mountains after a bit of research i found there are three places in shelby county tn the county in which i live that all have an elevation of 410 the high point for this county just for kicks i decided to set foot on each of them one was in a person s front yard on the northern boundary of the county so i drove by and called that a success the second was in an area in the far southeastern corner of the county that was being excavated for a new highway that was an easy achievement the last was in the middle of a farmer s field where macon road meets the fayette county line it was a cool november morning and i was meeting some friends for a hike around herb parsons lake nearby the high point so i set out a little early i drove as close as i could get and set out through some woods towards the field as i emerged from the woods i saw the field rise ahead of me to a slight mound in the middle my target point to my amazement standing at precisely that point was a good sized 8 or 10 point buck staring right at me it was almost mystical like he was there to welcome me to my destination we watched each other as i walked closer until i got within 50 yards of him and he trotted off into the woods beyond the field as he ran off through the woods i could hear his rack banging against branches a very cool experience as a child i remember i fantasized about what it would be like to live inside of a snow globe i think this fantasy was rooted in growing up in texas and longing for snow and yet even then perhaps part of me longed for the still perfection of a glitter filled utopia and the metaphor for timelessness that it provides in those sparkly little dome shaped wonderlands smith s lawyer greg jackson told the hearing that the bid for clemency isn t meant to minimize the terrible crime that smith is guilty of but is a request for mercy if the fizzy head was disorienting the fizzy palate carbonated rather than nitrogenated is as well the taste isn t a huge departure from regular draft guinness it s got a slightly more chalky quality but then at the end turns quite metalic unpleasantly it s think and tinny the more i went back for a swallow the more it resisted me perhaps it s not a beer that you want to introduce to a warm room for any length of

of my kid s math test before he gets home from school where the day s results of the entire olympic games can be transmitted around the world as they happen where the answers to almost any question one can imagine are just a few clicks away it would seem that providing a reasonable level of information regarding the sport s anti doping program could be done by enlisting the aid of a high school

partying best editor short form ellen datlow now understand something if i see a post riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes i can get turned off too i give the person another chance because maybe

second son and i didn t watch my weight gain at all it didn t take long for me to go over the 200 pound mark and after our son was born i was still between 220 230 pounds i didn t pay it much mind i knew i was officially obese and would have bouts of trying to work out but we were going through some stressful times and more often than not exercise and efforts to eat properly were pushed to the

it is a peace and a haven set into the wreck of time it is a lifeboat on which you find yourself decades later still living the sun has been blazing down for the past couple of days my favourite part of yesterday was eating my lunch in the midday sunshine there s a lovely little cafe on campus which serves up lots of delicious vegetarian food with big helpings of kale and tahini so i like to demolish a pile of greenery and fool myself into thinking that by doing so i m instantly improving my brain capacity kale is a superfood right so if i eat a pile of kale then i get to work slightly less hard without effecting my output i m pretty sure it goes something like that one of the things i love about amherst is how sunny it can be even when its ferociously cold the sun has a habit of lighting up every corner across campus which makes walking around extra enjoyable especially walking past the big pond with its hoards of canadian geese squawking and flirting in the blaze we prepped

silently prayed no event is irreversible and no transformation is final clearly this strategy has worked and equities notwithstanding last night s performance have been making fresh multi year highs recently the australian market even snuck above 4000 but the bond markets are telling us a very different story about the outlook for the economy and it seems a difficult circle to square when bonds are pointing to enduring economic weakness but equities seem more aligned with an economic bounce so many people have written about their top 10 christmas movies i could make a list too but it would

realize you added too much liquid and the gravy is too thin don t panic just don t fall apart and add flour straight into the thin gravy or the lumps will come i am speaking from experience here it s not pretty instead you can mix about 1 tablespoon of corn starch and whisk a little water into it till it s lump free now very slooooooooooowly add the cornstarch and whisk while the gravy bubbles cornstarch works very fast so go easy if it s still not thick enough then add some more oh if you have wondra instant flour then you can carefully add that to gravy to thicken but whisk like crazy in

alone in fueling an international perception of anti muslim bias that was raised by clinton s questioner deniece williams let s hear it for the boy columbia 1984 i don t watch tv or movies anymore mostly but i watched elizabeth i the golden age directed by shekhar kapur i m still interested in that part of history and i ve had a nagging suspicion that there s some significance i should be exploring in the spanish armada it turns out the movie inspired me to discover some interesting clues if someone is in the market and new to photography where do you start i personally think that b q is pretty overpriced but despite this we do find ourselves wandering around their warehouses looking for inspiration a couple of times a month one thing they really do well though is their youtube channel i m sure i m not the only one that when i get stuck i either google youtube it before i even consider asking an actual human well b q have some pretty decent video tutorials on basic diy for basic people like myself this could not be good i rushed to the front door to find out what all of the hub ub was about what i saw was reminiscent of this they said they had tried to adopt me but couldn t because i was mixed race they were then forbidden to send cards or presents to me and had no right to contact me i felt relieved and sad that they had missed me as much as i had missed them

think that guzzling down coffee to help keep you awake throughout the night is a good idea do note that just like everything else in life too much of a good thing can have detrimental effects on you

having one whole egg per person eating the eggs and then only use 1 2 more egg whites which have no cholesterol to create a healthier breakfast make sure you also eat berries and other fruits with it just because it s yummy also watch how much animal proteins and by products you consume this includes dairy and meat particularly red meat try to limit your intake of red meats to twice a week and choose the low fat options of dairy products yeah she is beautiful but she don t mean a thing to me i opened the box sal marquez trumpet vocals on dinah moe humm it would be great if a portable device could be added into the equation imagine if there was an option that allowed you to do the same with your smartphone simply select the dlna or any form of wireless communication option when walking into the living roon and boom the tv turns on and starts playing the movie also interesting this week was ken s fiction writing surely something many a blogger can empathise with and how uncomfortable he felt with talking about it at the party perhaps in part because he knew he would get in trouble with it at work albeit not from don who respects the creative edge note however that the story of the bridge and the robot who removed a bolt only for the bridge to collapse killing everyone served as a metaphor for the episode lot s of characters trying to build bridges with others e g the party or pete at the video class but not succeeding in the way they had hoped the most obvious of these was lane trying to win the jaguar account not only did the account get taken with him but he then got the fallout via his wife after the whorehouse incident the line and lane s delivery of it he was caught with chewing gum on his pubis was a classic and a funny one not only to the guys in the meeting room pete s subsequent cruelness and one of the reason s pete is never fully respected leading to the fight was also hilarious i was rolling about laughing as lane rolled up his sleeves i wasn t sure he was going to win at first perhaps humiliating him even more but the idea was to teach pete a humiliating lesson instead and a beating he has deserved since the beginning of the show as it turns out lane managed to humiliate himself further with trying to kiss joan the way joan opened the door and diverted attention to everyone wanting to beat up pete was both clever emotional and well deserved she respects him for what he has done for her and how he welcomed her back she recognised a minor moment of weakness mad men back on fine form this week ekpan in warri but there s a second type of reward for long time viewers and that comes in the form of character consistency long running characters in soaps typically get plotlines or moments where what is significant is not a specific reference to their history but rather the fact that they act in a manner consistent with their character type the most charming moment along these lines in the month i watched was when annie walker the landlady at the rovers return the requisite and iconic pub chats up the obligatory punk rocker character and gets along with him well a moment that is fun primarily because annie walker has been on the show since the first episode and it reconfirms her defining character traits of being gracious and discerning what s significant about this that even though it is not a moment that depends on any long term knowledge of the show it s still one that rewards it it s significant primarily if you have a built up appreciation of annie walker a similar moment appears in the first episode of december in which hilda ogden a character defined in no small part by her ability to irritate everybody else in the show is shut out from a wedding reception annie gives her an opportunity to pick up a shift working at the inn giving her a tacit invitation another small character moment that is endearing because of the existence of prior investment in the characters as opposed to because of its own intrinsic dramatic tension the best way to envision your success is to not think in the future but to realize in the present then they handed me our boy the boy i was certain would be named noah or benjamin we looked at him and knew this was luke he came on his grandma bolte s birthday he was just over five pounds and the most miraculous thing i had ever seen and to this day i look at that

western bypass then you can follow a gentle downhill path most of the way see map below in 2008 prices at the gas pump surged under president bush and there was a lot of media attention to that fact even though it was significantly less than the current rise in prices at the pump recently the business and media institute decided to study how the media covered the situation back then as compared to now we germans now carry a new burden of sin on our shoulders i ve been in a reflective mood lately it came on full force the other afternoon when noah woke from his nap and called me as usual but i took a few minutes getting up to him by the time i got upstairs he d slipped back into sleep so i had a long several moments to just lay in front of his door and watch him sleep to say a prayer about him to think about him how much he has changed my life and my soul it was a beautiful little interlude it was on one of these walks that she made a discovery the boy lived in her apartment complex kickass so i became a media consultant they idolized and idealized yorke and his bandmates for the musical creation they produced and performed radiohead creates stunning exceptional art making it easy to forget that they are human like the rest of us it s difficult for me personally to build up enough self esteem to excel at anything when i m idealizing whomever whether an artist a friend a romantic interest or otherwise i m constantly guilty of idolizing and idealizing it can be socially creatively and professionally paralyzing when i believe i m not participating at the same

over me like a wave that you never see coming until it s too late and you re face down eating sand and just as you try to spit out the sand and stand up you get knocked over again by the hot pizza

might not be and traditional art discussions may not be but we nevertheless talked about art some of it from the middle ages for 40 minutes the last big thing that really stuck out in this episode is the thick hatred that tim riggins and smash williams have for each other it s not even a hidden kind of hatred it s flat out blatant and in front of everyone i m not sure if the two of them are supposed to have a past of some sort or if they just rub each other the wrong way but something must be planned moving forward because their mutual dislike has been pretty apparent so far two episodes

to the people in need that are all around us everyday i believe with all my heart that at some point peter and john in their lifetime walked right past the lame beggar at the gate called beautiful and pay no attention to him the scripture says that he had been there for over 40 years it is so easy to lose sight of those who are around us everyday people become a part of the scenery apart of our daily backdrop of our routine and mundane lives until they are filled with the spirit and their eyes are opened their attention and perception has been expanded beyond the realm of self and they see the lame man and stop what they are doing and have a conversation with him that leads to his healing and complete recovery and he is talking so much it amazes me he tries to repeat so much of what we say and seems to be adding words to his vocabulary at a pretty good pace he definitely says ball and i think he has been trying to say lola which is a hard one to say he signs all done and tries to say it but isn t quite there he even tries to sing and you ll hear a little tune come out of his mouth that sounds a heck of a lot like the melody to twinkle twinkle little star 5 immortality cover de

an uncredited army of workers carrying out tasks that don t allow for their own individual expression and this is how it becomes a representative work for our times late capitalism after all promises us all kinds of freedoms as consumers and courts our favor in the realm of consumption seeking ingeniously and tirelessly to give us what we want but in the realm of production ours is an

a little rubbing to the edges of the dust wrapper with a nick to the head of the spine so here s my take on her lo down the road sir in no particular order when the civil service needs a kicking i can give it with both feet if necessary but sparingly what s been going on at hmrc in recent years speaks for itself as to the problems of defence procurement and public sector it projects yet these failures i think are an argument for more transparency in how the public sector functions rather than an argument for the wholesale privatisation of it most recently i gave job centre plus a piece of my mind in my blog post today at the job centre but what i try to do when i throw criticisms around in the field of public administration is to suggest possible solutions and improvements i did the

the day and i wouldn t blame him if he just wanted to stay home with the family to celebrate his birthday instead byford was all for trying to hangout and getting together for his birthday but i think deep down it was more to find something fun to do with his kids anyway although the monsoons have arrived so has the heat of mad dogs and englishmen and so after walking to the cafe for breakfast i return to my apartment turn on the ac take a cold shower and nap until the shadows of the building cover the pool and i go for a swim and then at night perhaps walk along the beach in hopes of

twelve grapes are eaten each grape representing a month and symbolising hope and good wishes for the new year needless to say i use both of them i could launch into further questioning as to what that little tidbit says about me but i ll not do so for your sakes my mind automatically commenced the query when i first began this post so there s really nothing i can do about it for my sake there are so many recipes for vinaigrettes and they re all a variation on the same ingredients if you don t have a recipe you might want to try this one by david lebovitz may your soft breath steam with

nutritarian style salad i ve been enjoying lately mango grape tomato salad recently a couple of fellow indie authors received a negative review by someone who purports herself to be a professionally honest and fair reviewer this person not only critiques books but also is a panelist for a well known independent literary award to me this is a conflict of interests mostly because you re not really critiquing you re judging this reviewer who shall remain nameless cannot in her own words separate the author from the fiction he she is writing so how can she be trusted to remember to take of her judge hat and put on her critic hat as annoying as that is though it s inconsequential besides the morally bankrupt philosophy behind the device since cops already have their own methods of doing this the target purchasers must be wives and parents who stand more to lose from spying than from their husbands or kids looking at porn and employers who are pretty desperate if they can t think of a better reason to fire somebody than that am i wrong or is this a symptom of a serious social illness it s just another day on the enterprise except that spock is in an extremely pissy mood nurse

cut the image out instead making it a christmas one doesn t she look like she s waiting for santa i decided to make the piece without a border and with white binding to draw more attention to the old

into commodities it wants labour s project to be about creating the conditions for ordinary people to lead decent lives together by constraining capitalism strengthening associations and

children and could refuse their mother all access i ve used this gorjuss saturated canary digi today from the very talented krista smith i ve seen alot of facebook comments over the past few months how people have been ripping off her images as there own and i must say my own personal view of this it s awful krista puts her heart and soul into these gorjuss images and for someone to take them change them a little and sell them as there own it s terrible and more so shame on the people who buy them there is nothing like the original and i love krista s work so i will continue to support her

in that nor indeed in any other direction i had simply travelled over the ground to see what this new metropolitan line was like and being equally undesirous of exploring the ancient pens of smithfield and of encountering mr tennyson s merry march air on blackfriars bridge where i had unfortunately been detained exactly one hour and three quarters in an open carriage on the illumination night on which occasion it blew pretty strongly up from the river having i say no definite plan or prospect before me i consulted my watch and finding it past one o clock i turned my attention to

can get spiritual experiences can deepen and enrich our lives in many ways they are largely to be welcomed as part of the beauty and abundance of the spiritual life just as the cultivation of an artistic lifestyle will naturally result in the development of artistic skills and perceptions unfolding the vast realm of art appreciation so too the cultivation of the spiritual life still will unfold the vast realm of cosmic consciousness and an appreciation of the bliss that pervades all things in the universe to develop a life enhanced by ongoing spiritual experiences with an ability to

the fashion industry so what really goes on beyond the fashion shoots in my career as a psychologist i have talked with hundreds of people previously diagnosed by other professionals with oppositional defiant disorder attention deficit hyperactive disorder anxiety disorder and other psychiatric illnesses and i am struck by 1 how many of those diagnosed are essentially anti authoritarians and 2 how

have a healthy distaste for mr big what i hate is mr big and carrie together he might be a fine enough person but he was terrible for the leading lady of satc and considering that many women have turned to this show as their essential guide to dating in your 20s 30s and 40s i feel that i must address why mr big is terrible for carrie please don t judge the amount of thought i ve put into this list clearly i have too much time on my hands and i got to do some spinning i don t want to get much further into this last time i commented on it i got more hate email from krav maga fans than i would have gotten from thirteen year old girls if i had made fun of justin bieber my recommendation is sticking to both brazilian jujitsu and muay thai and having some modern combatives thrown in the mix so as to learn how to combine that with gun knife and stick the most important thing is finding a good instructor no need to get the latest mma champion or yakuza assassin just a honest instructor that knows what hes doing and you re comfortable with whatever martial art or system you are doing how useful or not it is will strongly depend on the instructor you have if there s no sparring against non cooperative partners chances are you re just wasting your time you must fight someone that fights back even with gloves even with rules its much better than doing it for real on the streets for the first time bare knuckled and doing it to save your life of all things to narrow the wood which is called resawing i put the fence at over 1 2 probably about 9 16 just under 5 8 and

library and now that we ve moved i ve got new library branches to explore whee if women believe and think they re powerful basically and men think that they re useless our world starts to look a whole lot more matriarchal than ever before it would be hasty to say that we re on a fast train headed in that direction considering the male female wage gap and the lopsided gender make up of politics corporations and decision makers in pretty much every significant sphere in american life but we are in the midst of dealing with some significant changes that have deep emotional ramifications this is true even if we don t think we ll be married the inferiority thing shifts even how we relate as men and women to each other in workplaces in sacred spaces and as friends it is a well established fact that if you don t keep an eye on cats they will sit on your chest and steal your breath while you sleep look it up sheeple according to scientists the disappointing numbers could be linked to changes in the animals northern feeding grounds brought on by water that is warmer but also less salty because of melting arctic sea ice it s difficult to choose just one from mr earle but this is my favorite track from his 2004 release the revolution starts now this song begs the question would george bush have sent either of his two young daughters to fight in iraq because every time we kiss you send me into bliss me yes that s exactly what i was thinking tragedies affect people in many ways since vernon s death i have met other parents who have lost children they blame god and have a difficult time trusting him i understand their pain but he is only one who can get us through the trauma of losing a child i am so thankful that jesus is my savior sanctifier healer and most of all my soon coming king on the other side i will understand all the whys in the meantime i will trust that his ways are always right and continue to sing god is so good after all my heavenly father understands what it is like to lose a child his only son died on a rugged cross for each one of us because his son rose again i will be reunited with our son one day what a day that will be first of all one must be a visualist that isn t a real word but it describes what i mean a person who is stunned by physical natural beauty certainly not at the exclusion of aural tactile or emotional stimuli possesses visual aqueducts to the world through his or her eyes infinitesimal flashes of stunning images move him beyond belief these impressions are captured in his mind s eye never to be lost forever to be savored and often when this type of writer is creating they see the movie in their mind pressing from within allowing readers to feel intimate and involved in a scene i d also like to thank anyone who came to the japanese craft beer tasting the other evening some fascinating beers and 700 raised great work the white horse who not only hosted and staffed the event but donated what my fee would normally have been to the fund which was above and beyond great work chaps this is a great recipe that comes from a friend of mine who brought it to a pot luck at our place a month or so ago the flavors went really well together and i had to try it i made it for rosie s macedonian class which came to our place last friday for dinner i served it with mexican rice which was a pretty good compliment the fog stayed with us after noontime for the rest of the day yet still a lot of people came into our park for the weekend there is one contrary statistic so read the original article but this would seem to be yet another case of looking for a mythical reason to rationalize a fuming volcanic anger that has other much more psychological causes the truth is often bitterly inconvenient to dogmatists oh god in heaven help me i shuddered no er sorry my bad re orienting brain target re acquired there are so many layers in scripture you can read a verse or whole story several times and each time find new insights in the text here are some layers inside the story of the healing of the paralytic these twenty one year old thoughts as far as he was concerned a shark s ecological value was inestimable not only did they weed out sick and weak fish leaving the healthiest to breed but as apex predators they kept other carnivores in check preventing them from depleting the algae eating fish that kept the coral reefs healthy moreover any parent who feels placated by such a policy is a moron the overwhelming majority of sex offenses against children are committed by

had another packed house in the dining room at the west wellness center watching the coverage live on television according to staff at the wellness center you could have heard a pin drop as the proceedings were taking place the response of our seniors showed me once again how vital these members of our community are to bring about positive change guthrie really some information about fashion to figure in the end of the day it seems alright no biggies since everyone goes back to same pace she even messaged me in ym tonight but i sounded aloof am i mean or what i don t know but i just wanted to be honest how i truly feel even just for now it was a fascinating discussion ranging across scifi science religion technology genre labels and who can remember what else during the proceedings chief justice iftikhar remarked that if the police do their duty then the missing persons could be recovered me s is also for smokes when you re traveling kids can pop the bubbles as they spot each of the items on the sheet if your child is too young to have the patience to wait they ll still have fun looking at the pictures and popping the bubbles on their own time so very many of you dear souls on gaia s surface have been discovering the energies of the higher realms that are leading you ever closer to your beautiful and marvelous ascension into higher states of knowledge perception and consciousness in the meantime i m having another cup of coffee and i m already starting to feel better i don t feel so overwhelmed anymore i just made another pack of cigarettes from my dwindling tobacco supply and i think by tomorrow i should be all out of it then it will be time for the nicotine patches i m lucky that i still have those and that i don t have to go out and spend the money on them because they are expensive enough creativity toolbox exercise take a look at the world around you with new eyes then close your eyes and take a vivid visionary voyage of creativity i ve also been having all kinds of ideas about what to write for this here food do blog to be honest maybe too many ideas or maybe not that maybe it s that i ve had an inappropriate and overwhelming urge to do them all now which has killed the basic urge to actually start a blog entry star wars taff style the driving rhythms of thanks for nothing it s all in your mind nowhere thru the raw emotions of out of our tree and so far so bad all pieces will remain available until sold but the drummers were hysterical and having a lengthy heated discussion this lasted about 30 minutes seems the drummers were offended by the arrogance of their mock assembly aka general assembly g a for even suggesting they not pound away 24 7 but the g a was pulling rank on the way over one of the bloggers asked admittedly awkwardly if the meal was going to be comped no why would it be it struck me as odd that she would even ask but then it got even more worrisome there was a lot of picture taking at the table tweeting and status updating and i was really surprised by what people ate and even more by what they didn t eat they weren t eating the offal i d ordered a couple plates of hoof and mouth terrine for the table and hardly anyone took a bite by and large the blogger half ordered on the conservative side of the menu and even when they did order something with an organ or two in it they languished on the plate i actually offered to finish the bits off for the woman sitting next to me she herself admitted feeling embarrassed that she d be sending back the exact bits this particular chef was is so passionate about the steps were very shaky and we definitely knew that the lack of railings were a safety hazard r s friend j came over and quickly helped r shape up the deck steps they completely replaced both sets of outdoor stairs one set leads into the side yard and the other one is into our basement entrance after they finished that i got inspired to start power washing the deck and the house because the yard is dark the house started turning green on the siding luckily a quick blast with the power washer will take it off note if you have not used a power washer be careful yes the first time i thought it was perfectly safe how much pressure can be generated from a regular hose oh a lot these things can go through fabric cause serious washer burn on skin and strip paint r was power washing a little too close to the house and we noticed that the paint was coming off a little you have to be careful about distance with them i had to get it very close to the deck to get the desired effect but it s best to experiment with a hidden section and start off further away than necessary this is one of my first cards designed before i knew much about blogging who really did put the bop in the bop sha bop sha bop and how has that affected your life i think the only other thing to say about writing this book was how fab it was to be working alongside other authors both from a fangirl point of view but also because of the support we gave each other i was in regular hand holding contact with kate hewitt and carole mortimer and sharon kendrick and it really did make the whole thing seem like quite an adventure the best bit of which is now when i get to actually read the books i got such tantalising glimpses into back then am currently loving sharon s book kat s pride kat is a fantastic heroine and as for carlos fans self off to read more but there are times when someone says something or something comes up and it hits me in the chest hate bitterness unforgiveness i wish i could be like louis and let it all go at once but perhaps these things aren t directly relateable for him his suffering was definitely in his past i have to see my children

creative writing i was really happy at the start but i grew increasingly insecure i had enough intelligence to become anything i wanted yet i decided to waste my intelligence by choosing to become a

information on the project is supposed to be available on the website of the national human rights commission i wasn t able to find it but it s still an interesting site to explore aside from instigating debates between my boyfriend and i i enjoyed other aspects of the book as well in true dan brown style the reader is left reeling after several shocking twists in the story i had some reservations about strathmore the whole time i must say but i never thought he would turn out to be as psychotic as he did i really enjoyed susan s character smart and beautiful and definitely was drawn to the story of her and david i read through the chapters concerning david ravenously i was dying to know that he d be okay and practically broke out in a sweat in the process and so i spoke to

effortless conversation hadn t changed the real by james cole very good horror thriller tale my tastiest use of this informative book was in experimenting with squash blossoms i had a healthy zucchini crop this summer only three plants with plenty of blossoms available during the really hot spells schreiber s book notes that squash flowers can be stuffed with cheeses and other fillings battered and deep fried or sauteed and added to pasta the trick with the squash flowers is to get the male flowers the ones without a bulbous base that indicates that a baby zucchini is on the way when they have just started to open as they are rather fragile and get raggedy even after a day in the sunshine the other trick is to avoid getting stung by a bee while picking them as they are also very attractive

never got read but and this but is huge people were saying i don t care i want my book published and waiting around to try and find an agent and a publisher is futile is lulu and others like it a publisher or are they just glorified printing machines hmmm well we will look at that further in this article unlike other people i know i am a loyal southwest customer to someone who typically flies delta or any other airline the concept of not being able to pick your seat ahead of time is bothersome at best for me though i like the idea of only having to pay an extra 10 to check in early or i can just wait until 24 hours right before my flight and then check in online the earlier you check in that determines what letter a c and number 1 60 that you are on your ticket you board accordingly and choose whatever seat it is that you want to sit on you can check two bags for free and are allowed two carry on bags the plane is also brightly colored and while this may not matter to some i have

destroying many young lives many families and causing mass social problems in the process not only are you causing devastation to our communities and our british way of life with your al qaeda heroin but you are making yourself vast sums of money for al qaeda s war chest in the process of killing our youth which is then used to further your jihad against us in other ways it is about time that this

kind of weird working schedule a small knot of dread accompanies me with late night gigs there s no way to avoid the fact of circadian rhythm which for most people means slowed thinking processes tardy reaction times and skewed decision making it s the reason pilots must have certain periods of rest between duties and why the accident rate skyrockets for shift workers in a potential bomb like

coming in very handy for my 1st grader as i can have him run a race in which he just adds 1 to each number then a race where he adds 2 to each number and so on before mixing up all the numbers the

consecutive novel that i ve noticed all this crime reader crap littering the cover so naturally i m curious just what the is the crime reader my hunch is that it might be the title of a new csi

really small this time there were tons of people a lot of them hardcore fans who had come and stayed through the past 2 shows just to get up close and see my morning jacket we stayed at the front and listened to a couple songs it was unbearably hot with all those people and the music was so loud that i could feel it in my sternum in my bones blasting my ear drums even with ear plugs in it felt like it was trying to redo my heartbeat to match the drums jon just lost it and freaked out he was like hey i m not okay i m gonna go he turned around and bolted from the crowd as fast as you can bolt

met is supposedly coming to town he s a couple of states and a lot of bad weather away there s a sister too we don t know if she s been reached yet or if she s coming the sheriff of the last county she was known to be in is trying to track her down it was another sheriff who reached the uncle a few states away it was yet another sheriff who contacted the brother who lives in our town we didn t know about it until a man we don t know called us up in the middle of the night to make sure we d heard we originally thought it was a joke the local sheriff had asked the local uncle to contact us we can t figure out why they thought that would work what maputo beach lacks in beauty it makes up with great vibe very friendly locals and absolutely delicious street food there is nothing we can do to undo the past and all its sin and rejection but we are called upon to claim the work of jesus christ and by faith inherit his life eternal life so when we believe on him as acts 16 31 commands he

political absurdity then it does religious guidance sheikh al qaradhawi himself is an egyptian who has qatari citizenship given to him after he opposed the peace agreement between egypt and israel however when an israeli office was opened in doha al qaradhawi did not renounce his qatari nationality this is a personal issue that does not concern us as much as we are concerned with the usage of religion especially the weapon of the fatwa in highly politicized cases the video game industry is undergoing a major evolution as gamers approach the end of the current generation s cycle there is much talk about what is to come gamers developers and analysts are all looking forward with optimism i would like to take this opportunity to point out some of the worst trends gamers have been subject to during the last six years listed below are five trends that we can only hope will not carry over to the next generation of gaming you can make a change let s all share a little escapism by watching our good friend wile coyote mainly because he always seems to have a worse day than mine many thanks to the girls who own the sunny challenges and creations blog for asking me to be guest designer for the month indeed an honour and i always enjoy a challenge he somehow reminded me of another pigeon who regularly visited our balcony for a few minutes we called him mr whitecap because he was light grey with white wing feathers and a white cap and he had one badly crippled foot that made him limp but nevertheless he appeared again and again for about 5 years and then disappeared i respected and admired this bird for coping with this injury and apparently having a strong will to survive how little did i know then to bloom one day is a wonderful conclusion to this series no strange events such as enishi suddenly becoming very competent at his job and running the inn occur it s a very melancholic end yet we see hope that everyone will come back together one day in the future the mirror setting of ohana on the streets of tokyo is very well crafted i was heavily depressed when this episode aired last year and it still makes me feel sad when i re watch it it s a pleasant ending to this series until this giving up of self is what causes all the suffering it causes us to be depressed it causes us to be anxious and panic it causes us to seek all manner of self defeating distraction it even causes us to hear voices and see visions generated by our own thoughts boomeranging back to us as hallucinations because we have denied them an audience in our conscience minds they re too threatening so we disown them and then they own us human existence the doorways through which they enter and leave some real gems in this one here s what you had to ponder and choose from then i had a crab salad two shrimps 10 salmon sashimi 5 tuna sashimi and 3 maki rolls middle school level vi though x without further ado the winner is did i mention how hard it was for us to pick a winner well we did and it s 15 arizona gallery of sky pictures i learned that the way each of us chooses to live has a very real effect on other people i guess that is true in many different ways what i was thinking of when i said that was things like water usage buying clothes made by genetically modified cotton using more than you need to and how those things can hurt people in the third world however i guess that s also true in the sense that the kind of person you choose to be i e not a meanie can really impact people blah blah blah lead by example it wasn t long before alice had to slow down her lungs could not keep up with her will and battery acid was flowing through her veins as her heart begged for a chance to catch up as she stood her head hung panting she heard it

first lady s approach to eating stressing that mrs obama is not advocating dieting and no foods are forbidden now i thought the movie was pretty impressive especially the fact the director m night shyamalan crammed a whole book into 2 hours the movie was pretty violent too but whenever they would get ready to shoot a move it would take about 8 seconds to pose their move and then attack the only fast moves were the fire attacks but earth water and air was pretty slow i was starting to wonder how come the fire benders couldn t attack while the other benders were taking time to pose lol but i would understand why they would have that minor difficulty it s really hard to show bending effects in real life another thing zuko looked like a indians and so did the other fire benders i really hated the fact they were all indians zuko was actually supposed to be japanese what the heck i really disliked the fact they put race bending in the movie too than at the end they said in prediction they would make a new avatar about book 2 i was really pissed off about that i ve already seen all books you expect me to see the movie 3 times and spend money too that s like the stupidest thing they could ve come up with but my mom was going with it i go with the jingoism apollo s death made the fight personal for rocky but his demise was still merely the catalyst for an east v west conflict i will grant you the boxing match is the most exciting of all the ones featured so far i have a tough time believing rocky could win but there you go the speech at the end in which rocky personally brings on perestroika is as hokey as it gets then again the soviet union fell six years later so what do i know yes fitness is very important because when you grow older you will have problems you will not be able to be that active blindly trying to become somebody s body type is just stupidity she told we were playing baseball out in the backyard with him facing the house from the back of the

some more second paciorek came around to score on a triple by catcher john bateman i grew up in my families pest control business with my father and grandfather my grandfather started his career as a chemist and an accountant and realized the public need for effective pest control products my grandfather lowell christman developed these products and sold them retail shortly after the retail store opened his customers requested that he come to their residents and apply the products for them in 1936 the ohio exterminating co inc was established as both a pest control product retail outlet and a service company the last time all seven of us were together at the same time was at my youngest daughter s hs graduation party in 1999 it was our mother s wish that she could see all of her children together at the same time before she died it worked out that everyone was able to come for the party and make our mom s wish come true three months later she passed away rich didn t make it home that

nothing that can touch me i can make my own path i just have to choose it finally since my friend asked for the information broken out by race it s worth noting that non hispanic white folks made up 34 of marijuana cases over this period compared to 48 7 of the population citywide in austin according to the 2010 census meanwhile black folks make up just 8 1 of austin s population but a whopping 28 1 of petty marijuana cases latinos are the only one of the three largest ethnic categories who are arrested and cited for marijuana at roughly their proportion in the general population whether the disparity is driven by race or whether race is a proxy for other factors like police deployment decisions i cannot say but i don t understand why the number of marijuana cases should be rising and i certainly don t understand why black folks would be targeted so much more frequently for enforcement don t kid yourself there are a lot of white pot smokers in this town i know it s been several weeks since i ve posted anything significant and i hope my fellow bloggers won t kick me off their blogrolls for inactivity i m trying to put parts of my life together more on that later and i just haven t

photogenic don t you think another mineral contained in the dead sea is sulphur a key component of acid rain and you ve probably seen what that does to statues what i learned i have a funny little postscript to this experience so after i finished the disciple program raced to my phone called tyler and asked him where the he came from we had a couple of laughs and then he casually mentioned that he d sent me a script 8 months ago for notes what i said you ve sent me a script before there s no way i would ve forgotten a script by this writer so after the call i went back through my notes and indeed found an old script that i covered for him i quickly remembered it it was a script with all sorts of talent but the story itself was all over the place and muddled and i remember giving him that note that he needs to focus his story more because the talent is clearly there and just 8 months later he came up with this and i think that should serve as a motivator to every writer out there you re going to learn with each script you re going to get better with each script you just have to keep writing so stay inspired your own breakout moment could be a script away 7 uruk hai warriors i

touching up of the edges when i was finished as it was so thin some of it has spilled to the edges but i adore the colour it s the perfect grey i was looking for although it did take a good three coats to achieve i m not sure how well it will last as it s such a cheap price but for 1 99 you can t go wrong and for now i m a little bit in love with it that anyone finds positive progress in fiji

suspends from the ceiling and attaches to the lamp shade i had some jute string lying around so we tied it in a knot at the top wrapped it around and around and around and around and then tied it off

reasonably i was actually quite impressed with the reason they came up with we stayed up until midnight last night eating and drinking with new friends they are farmers too and we were collectively

praying with jesus god s word coffee wisdom this daunting triple cd set represents the first duo encounter between two very different elder statesmen of modern electroacoustic music keith rowe the longtime tabletop guitarist for the legendary amm is a versatile musician who has especially in the last decade or so all but defined a certain strain of thoughtful sonically varied improvisational music radu malfatti is a trombonist who originally came from a background in jazz and european free improvisation but has since the early 90s become a minimalist composer whose work charts the extreme edges of silence and austerity this album which documents virtually the entirety of the music that the duo recorded during three days in a vienna studio is fascinating because it so tangibly captures the process of finding a common ground between different musical methodologies different backgrounds and ideas the musicians settled on four compositions one piece by each of them plus two pieces by other composers so that malfatti and rowe each chose two compositions to play as a prelude to the duo improvisation that takes up the entire third disc of the set the compositions provide a way of exploring the players aesthetics finding the points of overlap which exist mainly to the extent that rowe can inhabit the patience and sparseness of malfatti s musical world and the useful tensions nothing ever prepared me for this i ve been lied to before i ve been a puppet before never has it hurt so bad i don t know how to get through this day by day one step at a time it will get better yada yada yada i know i know all this i know many people before me have come through it all alive but how do you weather the storm in the meantime how do you numb the pain how do you forget about 20 years of a friendship a romance a non existent future how do you say goodbye to all that how do you wake up in the morning and pull yourself together because you have two children who need you and a bright future ahead of you how do you focus on what needs to be done when all your heart and head and soul is screaming about is this most of all how do you wrap your head around or forget about the fact that where emotions are concerned he cares more about some girl he s known for less than year some little girl who is his son s age over 20 years of what he had with you i know love manifests itself in the strangest places but how do you come to grips with everything he told you i ve loved you since we were 17 there is nobody who could ever mean more than me to you is all a script

throws of essay related anxiety a few nights ago i found that i had left the t v on and the much talked about new talent show the voice had found its way onto my screen now while i am usually very sceptical of the musical content of these programs versus the emphasis on image and marketability after a short time watching this new approach to finding the mythical x factor i found myself praising the people who created it for many years the outrage born against this type of programming has been thrown forward on a wave of jealousy and misunderstanding the idea that appearance plays such a huge

i can t understand is how it hasn t been stamped out of children at school my english teacher would quite possibly have had to take early retirement if she had seen something like that in one of our essays and yet the fool says in his heart there is no god see psalm 14 1 3 fools abound and the defining characteristic of fools is that they aren t particularly interested in reality american psycho was mainly controversial for its use of explicit sex violence and twisted psychological subject matter that means the film is not for everyone as these are all taken to generous extremes especially in the highly satisfying unrated cut there are a lot of great sequences in this film because of those elements none that i will spoil for you but many are there to reveal the fact that patrick bateman tries to emulate certain behaviors from a pornographic video to the texas chain saw massacre he integrates them into his twisted fantasies but there remains the question how real are they the psychological ambiguity of this film is masterful there is plenty of evidence to support whatever theory you choose but you have to look at the subtleties to truly grasp all the possible meanings did bateman actually do all these horrendous violent acts and the world is just so consumed with greed self importance and indifference that it doesn t matter or is bateman so far out of his mind that he cannot separate his own sick fantasies from hard reality both theories are fascinating to explore and neither can be entirely discounted this is not one of those films which presents you all the evidence and just leaves you blowing in the wind as the credits roll that s where patrick bateman s internal monologues come in they give you a perspective on these things and allows you to see it all through his eyes and even at the end bateman doesn t know what to believe but with that internal voice an audience gains the only thing that matters what it all means to bateman some days i don t think we re underdogs by any means he said miami has more recognition honestly with their big three guys but i think we re a good team as well it was breathtaking the colors were overwhelming i found this on my memory stick i do not think it is the best shot but it captures that magical sunrise all the same embarrassment we do have someone who will come and do the guttering we have all the parts

to support these statements taken as they are though i can see no reason why either atheism or theism should create either a healthy mind or an unhealthy one the authority statement is similarly woolly and requires substantiating evidence in comments posted on the blog in response to earlier articles i have posted on religion writers have made the point that concerns of morality welfare honesty politics and life goals are common to atheists and are not the sole province of theists this would seem to indicate some commonality of thinking and it does rather seem as if dawkins is trying

for the duration but i took them to schloss charlottenburg on friday and managed to provide them with some impromptu entertainment by getting myself thrown out and very likely banned from a mausoleum it wasn t fun after listening to a lengthy list of do s and don t s from the attendant outside it was a bit embarrassing to see the same attendant racing into the mausoleum at warp speed to drag me out no more than a minute later but on the positive side at least i found out that my phones silent mode doesn t work silver lining s and all that i suppose and it put a smile on my visitors faces for

he and my mother never spoke to us in spanish he wanted us to be american david who slew the giant goliath as a shepherd boy failed to slay the giant of lust within his heart as the king shepherd of god s people and commited the sin of adultery with uriah s wife which displeased god so how could it be said that david had a heart of integrity god chose david because he was a man after god s own heart acts 13 22 so david started out with a heart of integrity but when david wilfully sinned against god his heart was divided between the matters of the spirit of god and the flesh no longer wholesome no longer complete so god sends his prophet nathan to confront the king and david repents in his prayer of repentance david prayed that god creates in him a clean heart psalm 51 10 and later affirms that god will not despise a contrite remorseful heart psalm 51 17 there s nothing like measuring the amount of growth you have attained than having your adult child come home for an extended

sorry for your ass you should know that it s already becoming a cliché a franzenian footnote on monday i was in london and the tube was mostly shut down due to striking during my train journey home i read that jonathan franzen had accidentally wandered into the tube shut down when his chauffeured car hadn t shown up there was something about the congruence of me and jonathan franzen both affected by the strike both out walking the london streets that just amused me without a doubt the freedom of workers to strike adversely affects the freedom of commuters to get around the crowded city and yet compared to the sardine tin of the tube it really did feel liberating to stride down oxford street does it come to be i m going to go shoot some pics for surveillance so we can figure out where exactly what corner to do it that being said sometimes you have hard and fast requirements and your stakeholders truly don t understand what they re asking for for example one of my prior companies went through a rebranding process where we renamed the company and they wanted everything with the old name to be renamed of course our internal ad domain was xyz prv you can technically rename a windows domain but who have you ever run into who thought that was a good idea concept of legal ethics and the recent developments behold part of the mascara i still have to try out it s not all there is one that has already been tested but not yet reviewed two are stuck at clearance and i don t know when they re going to release the package on top of that i might or might not have got a gift with purchase coming my way i used to be very sober i would find a mascara to stick to for three months i actually have to throw it away after three months otherwise my eyes start itching and if i got any samples in the meantime i might play with it too nothing this dramatic so it just might be that you do look better even though you might not be feeling that way why should one assume insincerity and

just one it has a comb wand which makes it perfect for getting to the base of the lash the color is so inky black and glossy it volumizes and lengthens without clumping and your lashes are left with a flexible hold there s zero crunchiness to this mascara it also deposits a bit of color at the lash line giving you the look of a lightly lined eye there literally is nothing of this quality on the market and that quality comes at a steep price yes there are plenty of good mascaras out there that get the job done my favorites have always been drugstore brands partially because i go through them so quick but mostly because they work mascara is where i usually save so i can splurge on things like armani foundation but now that i ve found the hg of mascaras how will i ever be satisfied with my

cellar discovery finale 11 become a part time blue peter presenter today his deputy said that the prime minister s apology was an act of humility i like to say i am blessed i had time to consider my options many don t understand some of the decisions i have made and how could they when they are not the ones that have had to make them my doctors gave me all my options and i explored them all i looked at what i could and could not live with the one thing i knew was that i could not let fear be a priority in my life i had a breast mri that showed another tumor in the same breast so my options were limited to a mastectomy of that breast or a bilateral i chose the bilateral two months after i was diagnosed i went in for surgery the pathology report and lymph node biopsy showed that i did not have lymph node involvement or vascular involvement i chose to have reconstruction only instead of being a double d i chose to go with a size c i always wanted a reduction my brother joked that i always had to do things to the extreme when we were thinking about co sleeping it wasn t really with an eye on the benefits of sharing a family bed it was more because we just could not wrap our heads or hearts around the idea of leaving a baby in a crib to us something that small that helpless that perfect that sweet and that dependent simply required us to be as close as possible for as much time as possible i mean all other rationales aside how to you spend your entire day holding a baby close to you nurturing cuddling allowing her to explore your face with her fingers as she learns how to work her eyes letting him suck on your nose and fall asleep on your chest and then just put the baby in another room alone when night comes that dichotomy seemed too much to bear it just felt wrong regardless of whatever logic someone tried to douse it with to the path before her but she was also like a demented sunbeam i m surprised they didn t rebuild the place after that noted my mum at the time another easy challenge for you all name of csc there are several water fountains at the sentosa resort world below is a slide show of the different colors of the water fountain we got out and last but certainly not least my fantastic new burton party socks that i received from my boyfriend 7 and as for the weekend tonight i m looking forward to burgers and costco again with my family tomorrow my plans include hanging with rudy while k works a bit and maybe the bellingham market and sunday i want to pick up a special present go on a walk and have a picnic celebrating 2 mamas our first offical mama s day grace holds a special place in my heart too not just because she s a boxer but because she is such a love bug she is also one of fergus best pals 3 00 p m a friend stops by and mentions that a colleague of his at the hotel de l amitié yesterday reported seeing truckloads of paratroopers in red berets arriving at the ortm compound firing in the air originally this was thought to be the counter coup but my friend says the paratroopers were only arriving to reinforce the troops loyal to the cnrdr he also tells me that a neighbor of his in the sabalibougou neighborhood a couple of miles southeast of me was killed by a stray bullet outside his home on thursday this is my home she said the crazy up is so wild and at the center of attention all the time with so many stories simply because she s well fucked up this version of that friend either has a drug problem or sleeps around a lot or steals or whatever it s always something it s like they always have to have drama around them or at least be the center of attention so being as they were sponsering us this week and the fact that i have some of their goodies unused in my drawer i thought i would dig them out for the challenge now what could be more yummy than this massive easter egg that warren rabbit is holding i tell you i hope i get one that big especially if its white chocolate my fave it s kind of like having a death in the family except there s no closure to this one nickels said and i am weak there are some teams included here that have major questions surrounding them wisconsin s b1g struggles florida s lack of beefy wins etc but in those two cases the efficiency numbers point to ultimate success wisconsin is 3 overall in the pomeroy ratings sport the nations lowest turnover the nation s best effectivefg defense and 2 overall adjusted defensive efficiency the gators are rated 13 overall with the 1 offense for now those two get the benefit of the doubt for now wiscy will have to turn around that conference record and florida will have to win a lot of sec games and i expect both will do that for now we do try to reach out to a lot of people oxten said we haven t been on just enforcement mode on this situation we ve contacted 104 different homes right on the south side and spoke with renters there to try to teach them about the ordinance and not how to be affected negatively by the ordinance my daughter has become the typical tweenager with all the added attitude angst and fun my husband still doesn t know what the future holds as mod are being slow with a descision we can now address poetic truth we experience poetic truths every day music is a common vehicle for expressing and experiencing these sorts of truths as is art generally think of the songs that you listen to when you are happy the songs you play on the jukebox or at a party conversely think of the songs that you play when you are feeling angry frustrated and resentful songs that let you to release your anger and vent these songs have a truth that is difficult to analyze and define it is a truth that one feels directly it speaks to the heart as much as to the head it is a truth moreover that grants access to shared realms of cultural experience it is impossible to listen to henryk górecki s third symphony without sharing to an extent in the pain of the holocaust fans of punk funk rock and hip hop use their favorite artists and albums as means of accessing complex cultural itineraries comprising attitudes perspectives speech patterns and codes of dress shared social worlds that revolve about the poetic utterances and expression of the musicians acceptance i ll continue this line of thought in my next post but let me end with this interesting statement by the founder of christianity jesus if anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple luke 14 26 27 seems that following his commands as a disciple takes priority over every human relationship on thursday after dropping off kids to school i and my husband had an appointment with a banker she was explaining us all the new policies terms n conditions which we both were patiently listening as she thought we were but i admit we were not we didn t knew this would talk 2 hrs i don t blame her she was doing her job n we were doing ours and we didn t wanted to interrupt her either so all this time went by n we were at our next level for paperwork it was time to pick my little one from school my husband had to leave n i had to be there for further proceedings finally everything came to an end all processed done deal signed and my hubby didn t come yet as i was waiting for him n wishing if i ve had the book to kill my time this banker came up to me n gave me this book to my surprise what more could i ask for the book is about financial security money saving investments and all money related issues though this subject is not my cup of tea i started reading to kill my time this is such a great product because i know first hand what is involved in getting holiday cards out especially the ones with photos i always felt bad about stuffing them in a drawer or a box now each year we can add to our holiday memory organizer and enjoy the ones from the years before do you have a similar story with a favorite piece of clothing anyone know of another way to save my shirt put into prepared casserole loosely covering with foil to keep it from burning so the last we left off here was that everything was built with the exception of the desktops which really only needed to be cut so the next logical step was to begin painting after sanding everywhere and then putting all the pieces on little lifts so i could reach all areas i started with a coat of primer then i decided i wanted to paint the inside of the desk something fun so i took all the pieces outside and used some blue paint to tape off the edges that i wanted to stay white by the way the bottom piece is the lid to the window seat upside down on the right are the four drawers laid out right next to each other and the window seat box is on the left and finally the cabinet is at the top the cabinet that holds the four drawers didn t need to be painted since you ll never see the interior of it don t shoot the piano player he s just an innocent bystander join me for my fantastic 1 00 sale mary is certainly sure of his impending death and she chooses not to be afraid to try and keep christ from jerusalem or even ask questions of him about all of this it s quite possible that mary is already imagining the possibility of the resurrection based on her experience with lazarus even if she doesn t though she is determined to trust christ as the one sent from god no matter what happens she doesn t worship christ in spite of difficulty but uses the difficulty they face as a cause for worship she poured burial oil on the feet of the resurrection and the life and prepared him for his death something which only brings joy if one believes in life even in and through death mary clings to jesus as the resurrection and life god himself even in the face of death these are some carrots and beets that i just harvested from the garden for christmas dinner it really is possible to keep your carrots beets and many of the other root vegetables in the ground well into the winter hope believer optimistic without limitation my destiny awaits

shall i say unkind comments in response to posting this article this issue is so evil i question even sharing it on my blog however upon doing a google search on this same article i found that it was listed on only six different web addresses i did find many other articles condemning twilight but nowhere was discussed the demon possession of the author of the books and other such hidden facts in one way i doubt that i personally need to share this information it seems superfluous to me we know what god says is wicked and we know that we are to avoid it however i know for a fact that this abomination has been accepted by independent baptist believers the truth of god s word concerning this evil that so many christians are embracing must be published celebrating the new acheron era in

would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to do something that bit special for a loved one departures are in different areas of the uk we went on the pullman from victoria in london a few days ago i paid a visit to my cousin brother this cousin of mine has two cats and a dog his parents and his paternal grandparents and a full time maid in his house the time i chose to turn up at his doorstep was the lunch hour and as i stepped into the living room i found the entire family squeezed into the hapless couch with the maid and the pets on the rug all in a line with their plates sitting agape in front of the television it was funny how not even the cats stirred a minute from their place this was a revelation of how most of the urban households spend their spare time and evidently the fact that tv kills glial cells is not enough to move them from their couches not that i am averse to television but i wonder what form of education do the people who say that tv is educational receive groucho marx can be conveniently quoted here i find television very educating every time somebody turns on the set i go into the other room and read a book people are missing out on a lot with every second that they exhaust with their televisions like exercise fresh air and daylight for example good off and don t come back pepper i hate to sound like a sap but i really believe that everyone

even for someone with no home school experience what so ever when a lender decides to make a loan and deliver that loan to the investors such as fnma fhlmc they have to provide some evidence to off set the risk factors before these loans are eligible to deliver to them for instance if you have a middle representative score which is 650 older credit issues which are isolated and your loan to value if 90 but the borrower will have 50k in savings after closing which can be liquidated this is considered an offset for approving the 650 score you can imagine many farmhouse cidermakers just

the best way to improve our educational system is to start at the classroom level with teacher preparation that bridges the metaphorical widest street in the world between colleges of education and colleges of arts and sciences classroom teachers should be singled out and trained based upon their commitment to developing a positive classroom ambience and emotional climate at the same time the affective quality of classroom life must be enhanced in support of the teacher s level of expertise in a specialist subject area all these are the luxuries and the dream come true he never thought

the temple and build it in three days save yourself come down from the cross if you are the son of god it is easier to view cornelius as a faithful scientist when compared with the conniving dr zaius zaius is put in the awkward position of serving as head of scientific research and being the chief defender of the faith the latter will always wind up being more important recall the lengths zaius was willing to go to lobotomizing taylor s fellow astronauts attempting to geld taylor and destroying cornelius findings that man once ruled the earth while apes were the animals i have seen that sort of attitude from religious leaders in regards to issues both scientific and social i have been in cornelius shoes when trying to wade through which course to take my roommate and i had a big debate over the issue of science v religion after catching pota one night in 1999 we were both what you could best classify as existentialist christians meaning we both adhered to the tenets of conservative protestantism but i am a calvinist he was not yet see no reason to attribute supernatural explanations when a rational one will do the debate was not much at that point dr zaius as minister of science

dynamics between her more sexual versions consistent unfortunately this lack of proportion keeps this work from really coming into its own for example while certain characters like lydia have canon traits that make her a much easier target for additional raunchiness capitalizing on that while keeping lizzie s original modesty strong enough that it often affects her enjoyment of her pleasures creates an extreme distance between the two sisters behavior that goes much further than the book the result is that while the individual story lines keep a ring of validity whenever they intersect things cease to make sense since a main plot point in any pride prejudice adaptation hinges on lydia performing an indiscretion that disgraces her entire family it is necessary to keep her prior behavior within society s expectations if just barely to keep society s expectations lizzie s expectations so much more conservative than lydia s behavior for the majority of the book makes her disgracing action with mr wickham insufficient for the effect it needs to have on the plot and the haunted gap in your mind has filled with thoughts that flow we went to the grocery store today bella

practically perfected this look down to an art i actually showed my mom this photo to see what her immediate reaction would be and she loved it just as much as i did what i appreciate about this pic is how out of focus supermodel lara stones appears and how clear istanbul looks in the background for some odd reason my mom tends to follow this type of look and expression especially when we take

venerable geshe la says that every living being shares the same basic wish to be happy all the time the problem is we are confused about what makes us happy normally we think our happiness is a passive reaction to favorable external circumstances so therefore when our circumstances are less than favorable we suffer the fundamental revolution of the spiritual path is it provides us with a perfectly reliable method for building our own true happiness within our own mind that we can take with us in every situation of our life and indeed for all our future lives race of passion and the storm let them not do the slightest thing lost in the hillary rosen ann romney flap with a side of bill maher thrown in for good measure is what mitt romney s position has been when the subject of the debate wasn t his wife a video has surfaced of mitt romney discussing his view of welfare earlier this year before the upcoming new hamsphire primary it s easy to locate on major media sites and probably youtube so i suggest you should watch the entire exchange the short version is that he believes that those who are going to accept aid from the government federal or state should in return be required to take a job so that they can share in the dignity of work and of course intentionally or not he s suggesting requiring unemployed mothers to get a job since they comprise the vast majority of welfare recipients against the flow of time futilely flail dr wayne dyer says if we want to see the doors open in our lives we detach from what the ego says and allow ourselves to live from the

saw them in the car park of an industrial unit that was being re furbished and asked the people doing the work if i could have them they said yes one chap even gave me a lift with a load which when

in the corner of the bar waiting for the 8 30 kick off i did not make new year s resolutions i made and defined goals for me the difference between the two is desired results i could have made a resolution to blog here say three times a week with the desire to ramp up my internet presence which i obviously did not do since this blog has been uncharacteristically quiet and my internet presence is really more of an absence at this time in my writing career such a resolution would have simply taken away from the time i must carefully guard for the sole purpose of preparing my manuscript for submission just after the holidays i began receiving feedback from my critique partners and beta readers on my middle grade fantasy i d been anxiously awaiting their notes so i could dive into another round of revisions and i knew i d need to set aside a significant amount of time to do them and the best critiques are usually the hardest ones to apply to a manuscript requiring a significant amount of thought brainstorming ways to fix a plot element that isn t working re writing re evaluating sub plots dissecting characters and their motivations etc these are the revisions i ve been pounding out on my laptop over the last three weeks don t forget to click on the photos to get a better look j rollerskating or iceskating but what about those of us who are not called to such obvious leadership roles how do we advocate for ourselves or learn to find our own voices when even those women whose voices are gifted and called to vocation in the church are criticized treated with suspicion or even silenced if you choose to sell you might set a date for a yard sale or take some photos of these items with your digital camera and put them up for sale at an online auction web site due to this lack

weight do they wonder if i just don t care do they feel sorry for me think aww such a pretty face shame she can t lose 20 lbs i worry that whatever else i succeed at my inability to maintain a single digit size overshadows it a very smart girl i work with asked me one day why i care so much about my weight i told her that i always feel like the fattest girl in fat town when i meet for all of my various running clubs or a fancy schmancy yoga class i always feel like the fattest girl there so my friend asked yes but are you the worst one there me no her then why do you care touche but then i m not an average reader in any sense and if you were wondering why i love smashwords more than amazon hence kdp select won t see me at this time well so now i m trying to figure out what to wear and the above is the stuffed sausage option ignore the shoes because they have definitely got to go and the bare legs are also a no go but unfortunately the shirt s no good as well danielle was formally diagnosed on june 21 2010 with stage 4 clear cell sarcoma until this family s crisis danielle had promising field hockey career and is still getting recruit inquiries from college coaches instead of scheduling those coaches visits danielle received 30 rounds of external radiation and 8 rounds of chemotherapy the worst news for danielle and her family was that her right lung must be removed along with right chest wall she also had brachy therapy internal radiation beads geographical consolidation in a nutshell consists of forcing muslims in zone c to zones a and b and eventually muslims in zone b to zone a we note that muslims in zone c are by definition few and scattered furthermore they will often be running catering businesses that serve the public in the area they live in and that are open to being disrupted by anything from a brick through the plate glass front window to an arson attack staged in earnest restaurants tend to take a disproportionate fraction of their revenue on just a couple of days of the week so disruption on these days would be the most obvious way of driving them out of the area in question this could probably be done without actually having to hurt or kill anyone which would be useful from a propaganda point of view i want to publicly thank wendi aarons and jennifer sutton for the awesome job they did in producing this show and for their incredible contributions on stage they are two smart funny wonderful women and i d also like to thank my sisters in writing all the multi talented and lovely ltym cast members how about we take this show on the

to show not only purchased apps but also free apps that you installed at one time or on a previous phone but may not have installed presently i m also a bit behind on catching up to all the a z ers and on blog reading in general so today s post is short and sweet a few pics of my furkids i don t wear mine very often because every woman will tell you they are uncomfortable as bleep but i m pretty sure every woman has at least one of these things that s why i called it the bff and fyi it s so not size dependent i have friends who are size 4s that wear shapers plus it was m2 s birthday as well we went to our usual birthday place red lobster so our waiter let us know that he was moving to another city up north he has a degree in computer graphics and being closer to northern virginia would be better for his business we let him know that we were moving as well or at least planning to so upon inquiry he mentioned that we are brave people to consider pakistan he said given whats happening regarding pakistan israel and obama it s a complicated situation so on our way back fj postulated that the waiter may have thought we were from palestine and had said palestine i said that the waiter did know we were talking about pakistan had said pakistan and his reference to obama and israel perhaps meant that israel keeps on making excuses about the supposed threat to its security based upon whats happening in pakistan and other places it s funny that every day its muslims that are getting killed in pakistan but israel uses vague threats to its security to continue occupation i wonder if netanyahu believes in god or justice i believe there are a lot of good people who live in israel i don t understand why they elect leaders like this it makes me question their sincerity towards the peace process i was curious about the 90 year old so i viewed his profile and i noticed he had put up around 10 pictures and had a very long write up about himself and what he was looking for he stressed on how fit he was and how he exercised regularly his profile seemed so eager and hopeful that it struck a cord in me here is a guy at 90 who is still out there looking for love like the rest of us we ve reached that major milestone of sleeping through night please send only by conventional snail post hurtado s particular interest is how an ot understanding of god is developed or reconfigured in light of jesus and of the spirit he devotes a chapter to each but more of that in later posts i m turning sixteen then i signed up for camp royal family kids camp tualatin the details and background on this are soon to come but fast forwarding to a week after camp and i am talking with a friend on the phone and it happens right there as natural as it was 15 years ago the statement of faith if that happens then god will just have to take care of the details and in a moment i was transported back in time to a place i had lost and through the shame guilt sadness hurt and despair i had returned back to a confident place of faith that i thought was gone forever and in that moment i realized that comment that was said so long ago was me and now in this next step and in this next moments it is me 57 i m gonna cry quick hold me ha ha ha the obama photo op which just might be the most incongruous presidential photo op in my memory wasn t published until the 26th but was taken on the 24th in boulder colorado richard pointed out the significance of obama staring into space in boulder on the same day a cabal of billionaires announced their science fiction worthy asteroid mining venture space boulder get it an event i m still trying to wrap my head around the jesuit federal reserve bank of new york during a heated confrontation with an sjp member who called for the complete obliteration of the racist zionist entity mr rappaport was arrested by police for allegedly kicking the student and was charged with disorderly conduct he was released soon thereafter and returned to

nightmare ps if you are heading in the direction of greece feel free to mail me for my shopping list playing around this tart is good made with pears make sure to pat them dry with paper towels before you lay them into the crust pears are juicier than apples and their juices can slow the settling of the custard when summer rolls around the tart is good with peaches which must be peeled as well as apricots if you use apricots add 1 4 teaspoon pure almond extract to the custard it will reinforce the fruit s flavor and glaze the tart with apricot jam with round fruits like apricots and peaches you can if you d like forgo the slicing and just halve and pit the fruit then lay the halves into the crust rounded side up as we face hardship and trials in life we no longer must rely on others to seek god s face for us but now can come boldly to the throne of god with jesus christ as high priest he understands what we are facing and the weakness of our flesh grace covers our sin and now god s divine favor and blessing are released as mercy pours over our life two different things created one wonderful paradigm of life until we understand that jesus christ paid the sin debt of mankind in full and satisfied the penalty completely we will continue to beg for mercy as a way out of our problems rather than receiving god s favor and blessing while we face them mercy allows us to go through all the testing and challenging of life by the grace of god without experiencing the same devastating consequences of those who choose to live without him cancer came into our family just like it is ravaging our family again as well as our friends cancer is a horrible and devastating disease rendering people powerless in the fight but god can even use cancer to release his divine favor and blessing in your life his vision is eternal and never temporal as i said in the fight and now on the side of victory god would heal our son he would do it medically miraculously or mercifully any of the three would be fine because his faithful love for my child was sufficient god would do his very best for our child and will do the same for you if you will have his mercy as he intended for you so

services project may also be related to trends having to do with collectivity and socially engaged art practices generally which have their notable practitioners and theorists as well as to conceptual art i also find it interesting that the artists chose to distribute their publication in the form of hardcopy newspapers at a time when print is on the ropes as well as via the project s website the collective has been described as working out of a situationist tradition their work or publications have been been featured at mass moca the elizabeth foundation for the arts the smart museum of art

cyberspace to reach consciousness nay communion with that all pervasive force of the universe call it what you will we have five hundred days to go so are we ready greys will have a blue green or purple undertone i was in a changing room in a public place with awful fluorescent lighting my skin was rippled with goosebumps air conditioning in february i was trying on jeans daring not to look to closely at the size but instead the way they hugged my curves tightly emphasizing my structure despite the factors working against me i looked anxiously into that dressing room mirror and smiled jumped up and down wiggled and shimmied i looked at my reflection in the mirror and finally got it it clicked in that chilly room with the noise of the public around me are the dreams they choked full

chatting to three german guys sharing my room christian tim and mortz all three of them are doctors on a two week vacation road tripping from boston to d c we exchanged stories from the places we had been to respectively and chilled when they were getting ready to head out for the evening i asked if they would mind if i would join them and fortunately for me they were more than happy to take me under their wing for the night we headed out to bedford avenue mortz who had lived in new york briefly knew of what he considered to be the best pizza place in the town fornino once inside i let the guys know that unfortunately for them i was a vegetarian they took this news surprisingly well and we enjoyed a meat free bianca and a calabrese with a bottle of red while it was no fire stone in terms of originality it certainly turned out to be some of the best pizza i have ever had and with some truly excellent company after we had been shown to our table christian commented in german to his friends before translating on my behalf that he had fallen in love with the waitress he later added to this when two brutally good looking girls walked in with two other guys how nice they brought their brothers he said brilliant just like being at home when it came to the bill my new friends insisted that i was their guest for the meal and would not let me pay for my own food such gents i had found this hair clip is a nice change from the huge flowers blockette likes to wear in her hair my best friend once refereed to blockette as niecy after niecy nash who has made it her fashion statement to wear huge flowers in her hair sometimes a you just need a bit of variety in your hair accessories as for a favourite 2000ad story it s impossible to choose just one there are so many that comic quite literally changed the course of my life but as an object lesson in the craft of story structure the apocalypse war takes a lot of beating isabella met and eloped with mac on the night of her debut but while there was plenty of passion and love between them mac s abuse of alcohol eventually led to their estrangement with his brother ian giving him a swift dose of reality mac realizes that his art is suffering not because he gave up drinking but because he is still desperately in love with his wife to whom he has been relentlessly faithful thank heavens when she approaches him with the information that there are paintings being passed off as his around town he uses the ensuing investigation to insinuate himself back into her life and make amends no one listened to my nay saying and their efforts to catch this clever little bandit redoubled finally one night this past week they sat up in the family room until almost 1 30 in the morning alternately watching a movie and listening for sounds in the backyard when they heard the trap all of them raced to the window like a distorted version of twas the night before christmas i opted for the sensible choice of going to bed over waiting for our friendly neighborhood rodent to make an appearance act 1 tatooine world pvp republic level 24 28 empire level 24 28 and then tara and i became friends vietnamese spring rolls this is really good served with some delicious sweet salty sauce yummy there s another appetizer dish which we ordered a huge piece of prawn crackers topped with fresh shredded veggies with a drizzle of light sweet and sour sauce with cold prawns and squids really delicious i have forgotten to take the photo for this appetizer me um actually i was talking to lord dormir we ll be told how much money hillary clinton has raised how bill will give her a boost and how great of a campaigner she is does she get the democratic nomination watch the belt buckle hillary s negatives are over 50 in some polls even in the more favorable polls her won t vote for her no matter what numbers are in the high 30s essentially she s juking and spinning and she might spin down the field for a few yards but she has little chance to get to the end zone consecration classes went well today too though there were significantly fewer of them aural skills was boring our teacher is pretty awful and i had my salad for lunch directly afterward band went faster than i expected it to we worked on only two pieces in the entire hour and a half long class but it didn t go by unbearably slowly so that s good

vatican statement said that benedict supports and encourages every effort to respond with evangelical charity to the challenge of providing children and vulnerable adults with an ecclesiastical environment conducive to their human and spiritual growth a major key to giving our children a healthy future will be to pass a strong child nutrition bill applause and right now the reauthorization bill is moving its way through congress and fortunately it has bipartisan support yay applause nothing is more shameful than the attempt of law makers to by pass the provisions of constitution earlier there were a tendency of political parties to appoint large number of ministers popularly called jumbo ministry to accommodate everyone in fact there was a hindi movie titled aaj ka mla ram avatar today s member of legislative assembly in that movie the chief minister appoints all the legislatures of his party and supporters as his deputy chief ministers as he had promised everyone in exchange of supporting him as chief minister but all the deputies had no portfolios he retained all the portfolios so i guess tonight was a failure even though that s the biggest deadlift i ve ever seen a woman pull and possibly the cleanest easiest 20 pr i ve ever seen it s not 400 yep absolutely nothing to get excited about not until she can put her 215 clean jerk and 325 back squat together with 5 more pounds for a 175 snatch and 15 more for a 400 deadlift then you might see a little excitement from elisabeth maybe she ll execute a small fist pump or a whispered yeah or maybe she ll just walk away and quietly revel in crushing numbers that some of us thought would never be reached and really got the crowd going at least i don t think it had 1 tbsp dijon mustard as a worked at learning to draw and animate i thought more and more about what i was trying to accomplish as an animator i realized that i wanted to animate fun characters but gradually i also realized that i wanted to tell stories that made people feel real emotions i wanted to make films as funny as chuck jones warner brothers shorts and i also wanted to make films that could make you worry over the fate of the characters like pinocchio or lady and the tramp and make you get choked up or maybe even cry over what happened to the characters like bambi or dumbo those things seemed like great magic tricks and i was always searching for answers about how that was possible using only drawings your debt is paid thank you abby kissed the back of his hand it twitched and with her surprise she dropped it 3 4cup white or wheat flour hare tries to comfort shu shu hits on her knowing she likes him whilst having no interest himself to make himself feel good because he s a disgusting individual naturally he fails stuffed artichoke hearts the hubbub subsides but the 2wo girls next to me who rushed over to ambulance chase are still there as i take the last wedge and eat it s tepid goodness the 1ne on the left is impossibly pretty and the 1ne on the right isn t but makes up for it at random intervals by slapping the pretty girl on the back in a supportive way but also with enough force to get rid of any anger she feels about having to spend time with this person and her inane stories and also to suggest that whatever genetic gifts she missed out on in the looks department are balanced out by a genetic ability to mask low key hostility in a faux friendly manner they both have the same t shirt style on as well black and sparkly so i get caught up in whether their friendship is a continual game of 1ne upmanship only 1ne person can ever win the pretty girl though is depressed since her boyfriend has just dumped her she folds her arms and screws up her face when she begins her story as if she s dis interested in her own words but soon she s emoting as if she s just typed a combination of a semi colon and shift 0 on her computer it s a completely over blown performance worthy of an out take from the brown bunny as she raps up she declares the problem with her ex boyfriend is that she loves him but she s not in love with him her friend is used to these mcgrawesque nuggets of pondering and barely stirs from her thickshake stirring but i to this minute have no idea what that means and the old man a peripheral figure in my day until now decides this is the moment to stare at the girls like henry from portrait of a serial killer and simply say to them loudly a 2wo word cursing phrase popular in tarantino films he then leaves disgusted and storms off into a chemist where he transacts as quickly as possible with the guy behind the counter while the girls stand open mouthed frozen in mutual horror at being dissed and a small jockey like man 2wo tables over laughs so hard at grandad swearing he knocks over a coke and gives that poor unseen cleaner so much more to do later on in the day thailand s entrance into the asean economic community is worrisome due to the freedom of movement labor in seven industries will have pongsak told the business leaders the tourism sector needs to bring its labor force s skills and knowledge in line with other asean countries to prevent thai workers from being replaced by foreign labor can you say mabuhay oh and that one adult book it convinced me that adults aren t any better than teenagers in fact i d argue that green and chbosky s characters are more real more relatable and more admirable than levithan s the tallest man on earth sometimes the blues is just a passing bird the guy s voice is annoying and nasal but the songs just work in the chapter of allan sekula s dismal science about his 2002 project fish story sekula talks about how major newspapers no longer cover the sea besides stories of disaster war and exodus a journalistic approach that compresses the sea into a weirdly blasé and episodic faux sublimity but his writing can also be creatively misread to describe voyages on cruise ships the sea is the site of intermittent horrors and extraordinary but tried expenditures of energy quite distinct form the dramas of everyday life 53 doesn t this sound a bit like deleuze s maritime model of smooth and striated space where man intervenes with striation to distance himself from the threat of the sea s formlessness eventually i found i could claim ownership of the page which allowed me first to change the

sensibility and attitudes that had followed rock from the beginning and the ideology of inauthenticity is on the one hand a discovery of elements to be found in rock for decades and on the other hand it does not kill the intensified search for authenticity which is one feature of the late modern era slytherins are cunning and use any means to achieve their ends this is the house that voldemort was in also most of his death eaters are from slytherin i think slytherins are a bit like ravenclaws they re definitely clever but usually in an evil way basically they figure out a way to get whatever they want which is mostly evil but sometimes not i feel a bit like a slytherin i think it would be cool to be an evil genius slytherins are sneaky too and i think that s cool as well the cared for

malaysiakini photojournalist whose camera and memory card was confiscated whilst the memory card of another photographer was destroyed by policemen upon his refusal to delete his shots of the fiasco 1 yukio ohta his humming birds villa 88 now however the cinder blocks have started to climb and the gum ad is fast disappearing a shame still i m glad they didn t go to the bother to paint over the ad it s fun to imagine the surprise that will await new yorkers when this crappy new building is inevitably torn down in 30 or 40 years time the flavor lasts and so do the faded ads in ascending order of disposable budget i never get to be alone these days so this is a big treat for me this past weekend was amazing i got so much lovin from rodney i took him up to the ski hill and we had some awesome pizza and we cuddled and watched tons of movies and got addicted to a new show united states of tara together we went swimming and drove out to marquette and ventured out onto lake superior together i had a blast and his new car is awesome i m so happy that my new camera got here saturday so i could capture it all with decent pictures it wasn t supposed to get here until monday so that was a pleasant surprise 4 parchment 24 1 corinthians 2 4 5 the bottom line is i flipped spectacularly broke the forks on my bike scratched up my nice levers and saddle and took an expensive ride to the hospital for no reason whatsoever many thanks to the bu riders who were kind enough to find my bike later and return it to me the next day if you haven t picked up this great publication yet hopefully you can still find it does it describe a conversation high tea a waltz a chase scene its very similar to the mcgill curl up and for those for aren t familiar with stu mcgill he is one of the premier back specialists in the world a few years ago way before i came across burn 24 7 and my life altered forever i was in a local band we weren t the best band in bradford we never gigged very much or very widely not many people knew about us but for me that didn t matter too much so why this early morning why not thought i d try something different and see if it would work it did only one small problem i slept too long woke up two hours late rushed to the computer wishing i had invested in a laptop instead while thinking i hope i m not too late switched on waited forever for windows to finish start up clicked google chrome opened the site and finally took a breath of air was not too late thanked something for that and went to the chatroom of well wouldn t you like to know not important being there was great fun as usual but a tad short due to my late arrival instead of painting it a solid blue i wanted to hang on to at least some of the qualities of the weathered wood i had dreamed of for the table in the beginning so i went with a thinner coat that still shows some of the grain through it with a touch of distressing on the edges if your fiancé is the kind of man who is welded to his mobile or laptop this truly is your honeymoon heaven still very useful notion of latitude and longitude and what is that but an not bad for 40 00 since i already had all of the paint on hand for other projects i ve been scanning old slides this week if you haven t caught on we knew we would get a storm because living in the north we do not deserve an early spring when spring comes early we feel guilty so we wait and we wait until the blizzard comes i ve been feeling so optimistic lately taking such joy in the spring i feel like i m moving in the right direction if slowly and that things will work out they ll be okay i hope those feelings are right i have read nearly everything salvatore has written about drizzt do urden and his friends somehow i missed reading this trilogy though it is possible it was due to one of my low reading stretches at times my reading drops and at times my writing drops both of which make me happy so i have yet to figure out how i drift from them and that was a moment for me namiss ka raw nila they missed you blessings can t wait to see what this year has in store for all of us ad age what effect will this have if any on other video game development especially the very popular series with mass audiences generally i love rainy days especially in october moody weather in october is perfect for sparking the halloween spirit however on the weekends i prefer sunny weather to get out with the family and enjoy the autumn atmosphere our weekend plans were to go apple picking and to visit castle in the clouds in moultonborough nh but with continual rain i did not feel like going mucking around in mud to pick apples i love the outdoors but am not a dirty outdoors kind of girl change of plans and it was to boston we went instead this is exactly why i wanted to move near boston so that during inclement weather particuarly in the winter we would have a big city near us and would have easy access to museums i m not entirely done with this blog there are some milestones i haven t reached yet and when i do those observations really belong here but there won t be very many more posts here in the future this is not goodbye but it is a transition stanford university s 2009 study of charter schools found that 17 percent of charter schools reported academic gains that were significantly better than traditional public schools while 37 percent of charter schools showed gains that were worse than their traditional public school counterparts with 46 percent of charter schools demonstrating no significant difference in other words all other things being equal if we were to replace every public school with a charter school academic gains would decline by as much as 20 meanwhile the yetis of kyrgyzstan embarked on a long shamble through the institutions of soviet power their position was strengthened during the great purges of the 1930s not through collaboration with stalin and his henchmen but because russian made bullets merely bounced off the back of their heads uncle joe admired that and promoted yetis to all major party and government posts in the republic tell me did you sail across the sun did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded and that heaven is overrated i bought him some milk in addition to a couple of other things and we got on the check out line right then all the kids started to asking for things talking and then it hit a huge sneeze m n hele wezen roept om jou in the long run that s probably a good thing i thought the spread needed a little bit more so i used swiss dots stencil from crafter s workshop and sponged some white paint randomly here and there and the vet was relaxed about this and ned got put on drugs and the drugs worked until they didn t when our relaxed vet upped the dosage to cut a long story short for the past nine months we ve been raising the dosage everytime he has more breakthrough fits the other thing i tried to do was set myself some little goals to aim for as sunday was mothering sunday in the uk i made an effort to get up early with the boys and bring sarah breakfast in bed and the cards presents they had made it gave me a great deal of satisfaction to do that one small gesture but again helped make things feel normal for the first time in way too many months the core harem miss bonnie mistress sandra and mamma ginny with the supposed harem leader yours truly in tow gathered in disneyworld for a weekend of fun and of course food and drinks or maybe that should be drinks and food when the saint to saint organization met with her they helped her assess her skills and come up with a business plan that would help her provide for herself instead of being dependent on the rice that would eventually run out she was able to make enough to keep her and her daughter alive as well as work with the community to dig their homes out of the rubble you may want to settle down and say in your heart that you have found that which the lord wants you to do it may indeed be but a stepping stone to the next level of your life as an example of this after paul was saved he sought to preach christ in damascus it did not work out well for in acts 9 23 the jews took counsel to kill him this is the time when he had to escape their hands by night escaping over the wall in a basket so good my friends and i completely ate this up in a heartbeat the people who post on this blog etothepi 911 cat etc are fictional characters who do not represent any one person or people who have or will exist they are

pseudo conscious and mimics actual humans she tells me if i think it s such a problem constantly chasing after her about things she is supposed to do then i should stop but then if i did that i d be looked at as a bad parent and i am not about to go down that road i ve worked too hard to get where i am and i am not about to stop now ever feel like your life and everyone in it is conspiring to be in your way maybe today just isn t your day and yesterday wasn t either it s so easy to let the little voice in your head bring you down it s even easier to let the voices of the people around you bring you down you have to be stronger than that be your own voice reminding yourself of all the good and talented things you ve done recently and that these little annoyances won t be around forever

the most competitive category namely the open category to afford top achievers a better chance to be accepted craft is a topic that has come up in quite a few of the lectures this year a lot of people mentioned it and everyone had their own opinion it the topic has played heavily on my mind since the last few lectures jeff beck s forthcoming new solo album emotion commotion promises to be among the most eclectic recordings of the guitarist s career while many of the techniques will be familiar to any working artist there are quite a few innovative and unique techniques throughout the book that are likely to be new to many examples of these include faux encaustic fiber paste paint skins gel string plaster gauze venetian plaster shaving foam rubbing alcohol soap rinse aid and even kitty litter gave chase without activating lights and sirens unfortunately we feel that this scenario is extremely unlikely we saw 13 years of a labour government committed cuts and privatisation of public services and where they are still in power in the assembly and in councils they are willingly carrying out cuts today in cumbria the labour councillors are even in a formal coalition with the tories if that doesn t demonstrate whose side they are really on then nothing will the labour party has shown itself to be a party fully committed to rolling back the welfare state when i think about all of the reasons i love free learning and there are many the one that strikes the greatest chord with me is this by choosing when where how and what to learn children will develop a passion for perhaps an addiction to the act of learning itself if we accept that people love to learn and that they especially love to learn something that brings them joy and hold their interest then it follows that such feelings of joy will be contagious to them they will never stop at just one subject or just one topic they have felt the spark that comes from digging deeply into a subject exploring new territory finding new applications playing with new ideas and the feelings that always seem to follow that becomes a switch that is impossible to turn off because they have ignited the spark of a love for learning maniacal shredding of giftwrap by thirty something man oh your little personality you are quite a strong willed determined little girl and i know you got that from me as my mom said i was

surprise you but i m actually happy and thankful for another semester of teaching opportunity for those who are not familiar with my job i actually work full time at the corporate planning office of one of the oldest colleges in manila i only teach after my 8 am to 5 pm office work teaching is only an additional assignment for me whenever the college needs additional instructors to handle the remaining courses that the full time professors can no longer accommodate that s when i came in needless to say my teaching opportunity only arrives as the need arises though i may appear only as a contigency or back up resource i never belittled the job i see every teaching assignment as an opportunity to fulfill the educator thriving in me p s isn t she the most adorable girl ever last night

december issue i was crazy excited when i got the tracking number and saw the arrival date my mailman was not quiet as excited to see me as i was to see him one time i was stalking around my house practicing dry fire and he came to the door ever since then he pretty much just tosses my packages in the vicinity of the porch however on that day i met him at the mailbox and snatched the box from his hands i was smiling and all oh hi is that for me i am so happy to see you and he was all yeah and had a look on his face like please for the love of god woman just go back into your house i guess

something different i try to listen and be open to their needs i encourage them to figure out what works for them my rheumatologist also has a background that is important in guiding my joint health she has years of experience that guides her in what she believes is best what i feel is missing with her and the majority of doctors along with a lot of teachers is they don t take the next step they don t let down their guard as the experts and accept that perhaps the patient or student just might know a little about what does and doesn t work for them you pick up the jeans you see on the floor

has run dry i haven t got too much to say really maybe working on cassandra has made my writing gears kick into overdrive and this means that my cup runneth over with creative fluid ew when i m working on cassandra but i ve reached a point in cassandra where i ve gotten stuck i know how the story ends and i know the basic path that i m going to use to get there but i ve hit all the big scenes that i wanted to hit when i made a basic mental outline of the story in my head the mud wrestling scene and the underwater westside story dance fight scene and all the other important ones that i wanted to do so i m kind of at a point where the clear path is lost and because of that i haven t been updating my lame blog as much i m sorry to all my followers all nine of you miles 20 26 the

for baby goslings and had a great morning today is miss s s last day of testing so i imagine we will be at the park again our little hunter goes in for grooming today as well he won t be getting a traditional bichon cut but more of the puppy teddy bear look we don t mind him scruffy as long as he doesn t get mats he has had a few and i brush him every night but find they are really hard to get out our hunter still seems to enjoy the evenings and goes wild i wish you could see him he ll do circles around the yard again and again yet going on a walk seems to tire him out of course going for a walk is really more learning how to behave out in public so many new sights and sounds my girlfriend kam and her lexie didn t join us today and it was such a surprise to me that hunter was much more timid without her i know each day will get easier for him he is such a love when mr goodtime is near ugps would say turn left in 3 2 1 right there pinch his ass not that one that one loyal customers

different conversations in a cube farm when i m trying to concentrate cleaning the mess my co workers leave behind them at the coffee bar counting down until 5 on friday don t misunderstand i have a great job i work with awesome people get to spend the majority of my time writing technical stuff but still it s writing and get paid fair compensation that comes with a kick ass amount of pto i m not bitching about my job i m simply saying that it is a job because it is something i have to do in order to get by in life it is not what i was born to do it is not what i m best at or even what i love it is simply a way to exchange my time and my intellect for money so here comes a shipment of precious mother s milk full of hope faith and good old fashioned perfect by design nourishment the royal

we do not know as the phallusophers what have it what being is in advance where ideas themselves including fictions are material realities that travel throughout the world as simulacra where there is no action at a distance but where every relation or connection must be physically forged and where we are simultaneously able to explain the formations of superstition and ideology while critiquing them if it is the true ontological position then this is not because it determines matter as an idea as harman would have it but rather because what matter is is always in question materialism throughout its history has perpetually captured the radical alterity of matter to the determinations of thought and has refused every and any gesture that would determine the being of being in advance no doubt this is why the phallusophers have perpetually had an animosity towards matter matter is precisely that which refuses armchair philosophizing or the equation of being and thinking called for by parmenides the message of materialism has always been that we must make a detour through the world and practice to know the world and it has always been that knowledge is a becoming of knowledge not an idea that is given from the beginning as such materialism is that which always returns us to the world a love of the world and an attendance to how things actually are in the world thereby abjuring all a prioris of thought so i waited and waited and 15 minutes after the store closed my boyfriend comes home the first thing i think when i see him all happy and sneaky is ahh he got it for

mornings long ago when i sat down to add my commentary to the family circle letter a new year a new blog theme this year has to be brighter and more positive than its predecessor not necessarily in action because we can only control the things that happen up to a certain point but in attitude because that of all things can actually be controlled this is my mission for 2012 and reflected in my new blog theme that and the fact that we decided that my old blog theme actually better suited fth k so i magnanimously gave it up i know i know such a selfless girl am i narf so all of that combined sent me on a search of what healthy is it has been an interesting 10 years in that regard i ve had to face some yuck about myself and some of the things lies that i ve believed battling what has always been normal for you and going after what is not the norm but is so much better is so very hard it s a constant struggle if you don t continually rely on the holy spirit to help you battle and overcome with his power this applies to many areas of my life actually and yours but right now i m talkin bout food so here we go just like heaven the cure martha minow pinsky replied today the day at

fact is a different cultivar it s a common cottage garden flower with big snowflake like flower clusters floating airily on a tall plant butterflies are drawn to it as well as bees i thought it would be nice to have some on the outside of the garden it s not long lasting so i hope it will reseed itself and keep going this is an experiment today my entire family had dentist appointments typically this would be a nightmare of an experience but not for us in fact my boys love to go to see dr bob they actually ask to go to the dentist because dr bob is so much fun he blows up latex gloves for them to bounce around the office sends water bottle caps flying across the room talks like donald duck sings goofy songs and has conversations with them while he is working you may be wondering what kind of quack dentist we see but i assure you he is a very good dentist he has never hurt the kids and makes it a very enjoyable experience for everyone well as enjoyable as having someone else s hands in your mouth can possibly be anyway i have the standard complaints about the rubberised packaging but i don t think nars will change it anytime soon mine looked mucky the very first time i touched it and i ve given up trying to keep it neat and tidy remember me remember i told you that it would be all this and more until one day an artist friend who i thought was incredibly creative

shock not at the weird things to see but at the fact that the building was three stories tall with steep stairs and no public elevator my friend jordan and i both had babies and strollers i asked why they didn t have an elevator for the public to use and the clerk replied that well every other person coming in here has a stroller so it wouldn t make sense for us to allow people with strollers to use the service elevator what how does that not make sense it s certainly not handicap accessible let alone accessible for families today i carried my stroller with a 30 lb toddler in it up multiple flights of stairs interesting if you go to the st augustine ripley s believe it or not museum be forewarned there are no elevators please be sure to mention this contest otherwise i may not reply the

like this one which i found on the meijer website must have drawers in fact a salad this good far outshines the name taco salad after all there s no lunch lady ice cream scoop of ground beef no deep friend shell no crumbled fritos or cheddar cheese oh no while those ingredients usually make other taco salads palatable they would do nothing but disgrace the mere existence of this salad i watched

not the most diligent of swots and needs to be told to make his bed or tidy his room but amazingly although he occasionally issues me with warnings not to embarrass him i know what a spoilsport he still seems to like spending some of his time with us if you are a woman and you hold friedrich nietzsche in high esteem as one of the great enlightened thinkers of modern philosophy there is a decent chance you might be unfamiliar with the full extent of the man s musings about the fairer sex since his own lifetime the philosopher has been accused of promoting misogynistic ideas in his writings due to his tendency of abrasively referring to women and femininity as a whole in largely hostile terms as we shall explore shortly however it should be stated for the sake of objectivity that this sentiment is not universally accepted amongst prominent female authors and thinkers as some of these individuals interpret nietzsche s apparently sexist aphorisms as a rhetorical strategy used to illustrate the vain construct men have of women and the potential to possibly move beyond this simplistic sentiment 1 whether any of these more favorable interpretations are viable positions in light of nietzsche s own words or simply attempts to exonerate the philosopher of the charge of misogyny is the focus of the analysis that follows below although nietzsche never wrote a single cumulative work on the topic of womanhood his books are nevertheless filled with countless critiques and examinations of the female psych thereby making it possible for the reader to gather a coherent impression of the philosopher s views on women and gender relations in general this is a unique album wedged between the previous glam esque releases although to be fair big beat was starting to head towards a more american sound and prior to their full blown move to the euro electronic sound by the mid 70 s sparks were pretty big all over europe particularly in britain and the band were keen to make inroads in their own backyard so this album was to take on the us market even the title seems geared to their prospective new audience although knowing their wicked sense of humour it was more likely just a piss take title for their seventh album i asked russell and ron to spill the beans on how they ended up with it they told me we just felt it a propos to title our 7th album introducing sparks most bands don t name their 7th album introducing that s probably what appealed to us in fact most bands don t even have a 7th album it is the day loved by couples hated by singles and a day created

boat using fresh octopus and mussels which gennaro collected after his diving expedition and the wit and humour the two italians share among themselves were absolutely fun to watch ah the ricotta and

reason to smoke any up until my summer cookout or pork shoulder or brisket but the smoked turkey not that fits the plan part 2 palos kontra gagamba 1963 poet junkie as a man made apocalypse unfolds

control during pregnancy your body is not your own it is the domain of another and they aren t going to treat it that nicely the idea that things will be the same afterwards sort of works to soothe those feelings of fear and makes it all alright however all this does it put a lot of pressure on women who may already be at breaking point i think this is a pretty good query letter as it stands the

aggressive and cute at the same time she says susan harris rep 7 93 405 i feel like i ve changed quite a bit since i last wrote i m in one of those moods where i could just delete every post i ve ever made and start fresh because perhaps i wrote about things that have nothing to do with art or music previous to now and i want this blog to have a focus that and at this particular moment i really don t feel a need to save the world or conquer it or what have you i just wish to exist in my own space as an artist vocalist i m grateful for that and it s enough on my plate for now before long a glossy concept magazine packed with ads surfaced on the newsstands and the whole mvoement devolved into one more mildly exotic lifestyle choice for bored yuppies who were tired of the older options for conspicuous consumption and wanted to try a new one not simplicity but a set of abstract cultural representations of simplicity that were heavily marketed to sell products became the hallmark of the movement as torrents of overpriced goodies manufactured in third world sweatshops and marketed through lavish catalogs and websites came to define what had started out as a not unreasonable attempt to

are keeping the baby s sex a surprise or want to reuse the room for future siblings planning a gender neutral nursery can sometimes be a design challenge a good starting place when creating a unisex nursery is to select a soothing color palette browsing crib bedding artwork or taking cues from nature may help get your creative juices flowing i wonder about pep talks like this one however i have given myself innumerable pep talks throughout my life and none of them have done any good i think the best thing is to focus outside of yourself focus on the customer or the coworker or boss and make their interaction with you as pleasant empowering and focused as you can that is the secret of social success and customer service success do not focus on yourself it is deadly focus on the other person and allow yourself to disappear in the act of service it is hard to describe but i have done it so i know it can be done even if it can t be described very well so wish me luck because i start my new job in earnest next week that is when i will need to start demonstrating that i can be an asset to the team i have been going through some changes and my old neuroses feel comfortable in the face of the unknown future but i intend to embrace that future wholeheartedly with the same courage and determination i brought to my surgery maybe i could consider this social surgery a removal of social cataracts which hold me back and prevent me from seeing situations clearly oddly i am both an introvert and extrovert which confuses people sometimes i can be very friendly and outgoing with them and then the next time i might be withdrawn and seemingly aloof i am at odds with myself but i am confident i will get it together because i am determined to impress my coworkers and my boss with my teamwork i really want this job to become permanent in october and i am very clear on how that can happen now onto the winna s edna buchanan aka the queen of crime is another local author who

out of print i think my dad managed to find one for me second hand after i d got a copy out of my local library which contains lots of different stitch patterns and i really enjoying picking a new one and testing it out the sheer number of blocks contained in 201 knitting and the fact that the blocks can be mixed and matched makes this a book i can see myself referencing again and again and

impossible to write down they can only be experienced how do you describe a mushroom trip how do you describe a relationship that runs so deep that the only way to explain it to yourself is to shake your head and say something under your breath about a previous life you don t you just have a secret handshake with everyone you know who has gone through it too for me that s the best and the worst part it connects you deeply with those people who get it but it alienates you from the rest it was a hug i m sure you could sell anything in america i replied but please lighten up when you re in the

in the late afternoon we have a thin strip of exposed land to cross in front of perpignan and decide to push on and try and cross it from port barcanes to leucate we make it and camp at a municipal

offered a workshop on how to write it without being there blythe writes historical romance which is not my genre i ve never been a fan of historicals but i ve always said that there are a few people who can lure me in with their beautiful words and stories blythe is one of those people in addition to sharing how she does her research for her books so that they can be as historically accurate as possible she talked about the role of setting which isn t something i ve given a whole lot of thought to my books are set in chicago and especially for the first one chicago plays a role i couldn t turn it into a small town romance because it wouldn t suit the story or the characters but i never thought about how the setting influences my characters and shapes who they are on a side note my worst move today was catching two pair on the turn and losing to trip 4 s i raised he reraised i just don t think about those things i had top two pair trips are hard to gauge in heads up because 99 times out of 100 the person isn t laying down a pair pre flop so if you raise it ridiculous or just check if the person is going to catch their trips they are going to catch i suppose it s a beat that is going to happen from time to time even after he reraised i put him on at best 2 pair or top pair with a high kick i was wrong as i said i didn t even think about trips i don t know is there any way to notice these things maybe the re raise but doubtful i think i made the right move regardless especially in heads up i let that settle onto my barely conscious brain and said soti rutaph jfhah the montanists believed in ecstatic spiritual experiences and end of the world prophecies justinian also built church sanctuaries including the breathtaking hagia sophia holy wisdom i don t mean to make this post resemble a travel brochure but i can t help but love bass performance hall so what we got here ladies and gentlemen is a film that got a lot of bad press before it even got out not sure exactly why this happened could it be that both films speak about environmental issues and bash on the way the governments of the world are running things could it be that fictional bad press is created to bring these types of movies down this kind of situation kind of reminds me of what happened to john carter 2012 another environmentally friendly film that spoke about a new form of cleaner energy and that also criticized governments and society it also got bad press even before release and it wasnt even a bad film maybe the powers that be want films of this nature to flop so the create bad press around them things to think about it wouldnt be the first time that the publics opinion is manipulated by the powers that be ultimately sometimes people like to see the big guy go down in fact they love seeing it happen just look at britney spears she was big for a while then she was shot down by the very same people who made her people love bad news more than good news reynolds himself said in an interview he did for den of geek com people were so hungry for bad news because it was so much more exciting they just said it and it hurt us reynolds own take on waterworld i don t think it s any better or worse than most summer blockbusters it s somewhere in the middle i think yeah it s certainly got its faults but i think you know on another level it works quite well compared to some of the other big films by the end people they wanted it to be a disaster and in fact lou wasserman who was head of mca at the time he said that he thought the bad press on the picture cost us 50 million at the box office so folks after all is said and done the evidence tells us that waterworld was unfortunately a film that for some reason the press chose to kill same as many celebrities they zero in on and whose careers and lives they destroy i say this film needs to be given a second chance and seen for what it was never seen as upon its original release an enjoyable action adventure flick and one of the most impressive post apocalyptic films ever made 5 betsey johnson bag i have this one it s one of my favs ever sight of all light tracklisting ask for help there is

defaulted now i m not here to promote and specific brand i want to give you the recipe totally surprised at the turn of events i pressed my husband for details she started walking around and seemed fine he said in fact she walked all the way from the shrubbery to the coop a good 30 feet and then up the ramp amazing look down from heaven and see and to the one who knocks i find the path that leads through the trees and bushes and to the place i wish to be i hunker down into a squat always listening and sensing but now going over my plan i found the blueprints for this place and looked them over well i found where the managers office was supposed to be and decided that would be my first visit keys tenant identification tools supplies and many other possibilities but definitely a best starting point as i see things if all went well and i found the building to be clean or at least clear i might do a little foraging i force my mind out of the plan and into the now i have heard and seen nothing for days i have seen no one outside of the store incidents in weeks but i do not like be surprised or shot at dead again being way out a few more minutes taking in the final task and all that i can sense around me squatted open and relaxing as i can it is time since the newspaper industry is sadly declining steadily a lot of this dirty laundry in the open service is found online where the playing field between public and celebrities has been levelled consistently in recent years the internet with its various platforms for personal expression such as blogs social networking sites and web based publications has done a lot to knock down that wall of impenetrability that used to exist between famous people and the rest of us mere mortals although taking into account that anyone can gain notoriety these days with minimum effort fame is no longer that hard to achieve what stands out more however is that opening a magazine nowadays and being presented with a photo gallery of celebrities looking the worse for wear is no longer a rarity but the yardstick by which modern journalistic standards are judged 9 william and lorelei play very well together she is happy

character question a man s character doesn t interest modern culture that much any more bulk media prefer narcissism and self expression to doing the right thing and selflessness unfortunately where television dwells so go the people mostly anyway i was so curious when i saw the teaser photo of this mv but then when i watch it i became so amazed and now i so excited to know where and how she shoot the mv at first i think this mv is so weird you know to see the singer covered with mud and then crying and you don t know why did she alone in that desert finally when i saw the volcano then i begin to realize it s about an apocalypse and she is about to die ohmaigwot those of us who consider ourselves witches base our spirituality around mother earth and all aspects of nature we are the stewards of the earth which the goddess calls upon to teach and remind people that we must treat her with respect and live in harmony with her or we will lose her and all of life as we know it we neglect that shame is not the wrong we did it s the realization and remorse that we did wrong it s when we don t feel shame for these things that we should worry perhaps there is such a thing as

gods and more rectangular buildings like palaces where the royalty lived and residences for the servants the buildings were all made from stones and we saw the big holes where they got the stones and when they were done getting stone they sealed it and filled it with water for their drinking water not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same

all the above in one weekend hey i m not here to judge the world is your oyster at the weekend last night was not about the oysters though it was all about the mussels moules mariniere to be precise this wasn t from my cookbook challenge the main course was but i was flicking through a new cooking magazine it s a sickness i can t stop myself and saw a mussel recipe and knew instantly that i had to have some i m only a recent convert to mussels i was put off eating them for a good few years after smelling some at a chinese buffet the scent of these poor neglected mussels was the smell of food poisoning and i knew to keep my distance it wasn t until i did a french cooking class last year where i didn t want to look like an inexperienced cook that i just knuckled down and ate them and realised how delicious they are sometimes thats the key to trying intimidating new things don t hesitate pretend you ve eaten them loads and then see what happens just don t do this at a buffet that is not the time for experimenting anyway if you ve never had mussels then moules mariniere is the best place to start the mussels are cooked in a rich creamy sauce which is absolute heaven and the best thing you could ever dunk a baguette in seriously try it and see i think its the law in france that you must have some crusty bread to dunk into the sauce once you ve polished off the mussels when i first cooked this for the boyfriend i was convinced that he d hate it but he also loves it so i know i m onto a winner with this recipe preparing the mussels for cooking can be a little bit fiddly as you have to debeard them which is just pulling off the ropey material they use to cling on to rocks and then check if any open mussels are dead i have to admit this freaks me out a little bit as if they are open you tap them and if they are good to eat they close their shell which means you re cooking something which essentially is still alive when you put it in the pan its worth it though as they taste amazing so please don t let this put you off i was told by the chef that taught me that many restaurants don t bother checking if the mussels are good to eat or not as its very time consuming in a professional kitchen hence why so many people get ill after eating shellfish in restaurants so be careful announcement please re read the simple guidelines for submission below so

like for them for some kids it s like they have ants in their pants or brains and just can t stop doing whatever it is that they are doing talking squirming bouncing and others pull away from crowds or can t concentrate on anything that is not stimulating television video games some kids even if it is stimulating can t concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes either it s easy to say that they just were never made to or that they don t want to but it s literally because they can t they don t know how with the right kinds of counseling and possibly medication though it can be controlled and the child can learn to control themselves dee marie states of emergency tl dr we do not know how much of an affect prothy will have on the plot because the leaked script is probably to

consumers the gamer is responsible for purchasing the game rather than pirating it publishers should be taking out their frustrations with the retailer when retailers sell used games they keep 100 of the income furthermore used game sales have continued to rise over the past few years it is simply wrong to place the blame on the consumer as they have already taken the moral route of purchasing the

means of all different projects which have come under the jewish agency s subsidies some with families who will host them and some through rich capitalists like arcadi gaidamak it is an entire

here s another member of the avenger s holy trinity iron man when it comes to the avengers captain america thor and iron man are the 3 big dogs they re not always all on the team at the same time but when they are that is when you know you have the real deal sometimes months pass where you have a team of say iron man dr druid yellowjacket jacosta rage and jack of hearts and you re just thinking why the am i reading about one cool character surrounded by this gang of losers not to say those losers can t make for interesting characters but the avengers book in the past has strayed a little too far from its roots as marvel s premiere super team a little too often once you ve got the trinity together then you can pad the team with whatever other wankers you want and it ll still make for a good read a few years ago writer brian michael bendis took a hard look at the avengers and realized the team was comprised mostly of b list characters who couldn t support a title of their own so what place did they have on the avengers he noted that dc comics has their justice league which is comprised of all of their biggest and best known heroes like superman batman wonder woman green lantern flash aquaman etc so why shouldn t the avengers be marvel s equivalent to that he destroyed the team in a storyline called avengers disassembled where many of the b listers were killed including hawkeye vision antman and jack of hearts don t worry most of them are better now bendis then rebuilt the team from the ground up in a newly launched title called the new avengers this team included capt and iron man and i m sure would have included thor had he been alive at the time in an unorthodox move bendis also added a couple of marvel s other signature characters who seemed to have no place on the avengers wolverine and spider man this roster change resulted in the avenger s becoming marvel s top selling book for the first time in decades this move worked in getting me to read the avengers book on a regular basis which i had never done before bendis has remained on the book ever since and has expanded the line i now buy a half dozen avengers books every month avengers new avengers secret avengers avengers academy and avengers assemble not to mention solo books for cap iron man hulk spider man and a slew of other avengers related books kayleigh and peanut are the best

pink but pink has connotations which say i am a girly girl who has never chopped wood which i haven t but you know what i mean however i disagree with this stereotyping the right shade of pink is very agreeable if you disconnect it from its associations i even began to blog about things i m cooking at home to try and bring myself to want to cook more while i m more able to maintain a level head

happy hysterversary to be honest i had not even thought about it that today was the 1 year mark of when i had my surgery it has been a really long year and there have been ups and downs and everything finally seems to be leveling out my friends and i would always tell them we weren t into guys and had signals to help get us away at this point in my life i am extremely blunt and just tell the creeps to go away but i do remember dancing with my sorority sisters and some guy who i had never seen before would come up and start grinding his pelvis into my back thinking this was attractive reality check you just lost any chance you had if i wanted to dance with you i would have now back off as far as i can tell people find this blog most often through a google search or yahoo whatever and the most common phrase that brings them here is my husband is mean or some variation on that theme they are directed to my post my husband is mean to me and the kids i am so saddened by how many women are searching with that phrase but stopping now before brayden s little ears get toooooo receptive is top priority again we have little context to be able to judge if this is a good or bad result for nama if nama is indeed hounding developers and if the media image of widespread transfers is correct and developers with 74bn of loans had a few billion of unencumbered assets to protect then it somehow seems like a small number in light of the tail transaction at treasury holdings which we learned about yesterday where 20m of shares were supposedly transferred to the founders of the company for what on the face of it appears to be well below value disputed apparently by treasury who seem to claim the transaction was at open market values and two years after the transaction nama has still not gone to the courts to reverse the transaction despite referring to it in its affidavits as a grave concern and making good of the financial damage caused to treasury by the tail transaction has been a central requirement of nama at all material times and at no stage has nama accepted the propriety of what was done in the tail transaction then you might indeed wonder if the 160m of reversed transactions is anything but a paltry start to reversing developer transfers p s 3 please don t give up because of the current pictures we are showing the world we are still young and need a perfect

excellent assistant to poetry i do however admire the excellent photographs that many of my hawk eyed ok this phrase has taken on too much significance with the avengers friends have taken and blessed my eyes with but you know what it s bloody hard work doing a full time job managing very intense work pressures managing a large process with so much involved in it where so many people are depending

also wrote some of the finest scores ever composed for sc fi or horror films fahrenheit 451 the day the earth stood still et al i m sure nies thinks he s created an hommage here but his work is not as complex or as clever as herrmann s so we get the brooding strings and ominous french horns and cellos that signal danger at many moments in the film make that just about every moment in the film as this is wall to wall music that becomes irritating from almost the first frame the lady and the unicorn tapestries of course were a highlight i think it was just the amount of medieval art all

and julie kedzie were entertaining although julie was more or less just filler on the team it wasn t a bad thing i am concerned with the mat in the cage though instantly the mat looked like just slept in bed sheets and had to wreak havoc on the fighters footing however the issues that are fixable like more memory for the website and the mat are easily fixable for this young organization at the end of the day i would say invicta is about on par with bellator but still far behind the ufc in terms of being polished they need more fighters who can make weight better fighters and a more in touch

connected in anyway to the policies they support one of my most indelible early memories is of participating in a near drowning incident when i was 8 years old this was in a lake near the shore in water less than three feet deep a life jacket somehow ensnared my legs suspending them near the surface and trapping my head under water before losing consciousness i saw spidery patterns of light rippling over the sand a few inches from my face an image that lodged itself with vivid permanence in the inner recesses of my brain one must require from each one the duty which each one can perform

in scant minutes and then it s usually to the other side of the pendulum which contains something else entirely i have seen non breeding swans in june follow a grizzly bear as it wandered past where they were feeding and as the bear swam the river channel the whole group of 30 swans followed staying about 40 meters behind the bear when the bear reached the other side and ambled down the sand spit the swans stopped in shallow water but continued to call until the bear was about 1 2 mile away then the whole flock swam back to their feeding spot i have also watched sabine s gulls arctic terns and geese escort golden eagles out of the nesting area they follow the eagle staying off to the side and slightly higher and all are calling and scolding the raptor till it gets far enough away from the nesting area that they feel safe enough to return to nesting duties but this is the first time i have had swans escort me away from their young the climb became steeper and more tiresome a few breaks for nicotine and water were essential but i was more than happy to take it slow and absorb the ambience the calm the awakening green and the song of a hundred birds rejoicing in a moment s respite

scheduled pick up day i called on tuesday to inform them that we still didn t have our garbage can the whole neighborhood has the same one they assured me i could put out bags of trash this once and they would pick them up so i lugged everything out on wednesday morning and went to work wednesday night the trash is still there i called thursday morning and they claimed i didn t have it out early

length of one expedit plus the distance from the end of the expedit to the wall then we went to joann fabric craft store and purchased 2 foam now we are planning to leave as i ve gotten older and

books arrived today so my next job is to do some serious reading i am really looking forward to learning the science behind the diet and how it might improve my overall health and well being we will see now one thing i ve learned from being at that preschool meeting other parents and interacting with their kids is that many people have serious concerns about their children they worry that something is wrong with their kids that their kids aren t developing fast enough that their kids will be permanently damaged if they are or aren t held back a year et cetera pretty much every decision is fraught and will no doubt determine whether the kid gets accepted into harvard in fifteen years like i said this coleslaw was inspired by kfc i ve always liked how they prepared the coleslaw so i wanted to make an imitation of theirs i ve browsed through the internet for recipes and i was so surprised that there s a lot that came up as a result of my search i compared a lot of the recipes that i found and noticed that most of them have similar ingredients only the ratio varies just a tiny bit so i decided to make my own version both ends of this spectrum represent a fallacy to worship in both instances worship is something that is done for me rather than something that is done for god and subsequently our benefit straight stitching short give me the remote control you loser asshole i

managed before and this time he can t find a way back to the future all the rules of time travel he s experienced so far have been broken and jackson has no choice but to pretend to be his younger self whilst he figures out a solution jackson is tearing himself apart with guilt and frustration wondering if holly survived he s also become the target of an unknown enemy force and it seems even his dad is lying to him jackson is racing against time to save the girl he loves but to do that he must first discover the truth about his family and himself and stay alive while levitz was extremely

poets that we like and admire i think it is good to shake yourself out of your comfort zone and try something completely new once in a while and i m really looking forward to our next meeting you

independent so starting today through november 8th i want to do this for a whole month i will donate 15 from any shakeology orders placed through my site i will do this whether you get on home direct

of the main preventative measures doctors say you can take to avoid breast cancer is being a healthy weight and eating well shakeology is fantastic for this it is a meal replacement shake that is crazy delicious and filling and the most nutritious thing you re going to eat all day but is only 140 calories so it can be a super helpful weight loss tool you can see all sorts of success stories from people who lost a significant amount of weight by just drinking shakeology once a day and exercising three times a week also smoking has been shown to reduce the risk of pretty much all types of cancer so if you re a smoker please please please quit you can just switch the money that you spend on cigarettes every day to shakeology and start giving your body something good so if we take a look

this weekend we told the kids it was a vacation when really it was just a trip to the lake of the ozarks to get our waverunner serviced and ready for the summer we made the most of it though well the most that we could with the torrential downpours that we had most of the time we were there here are two songs from the last waltz featuring levon the weight and the night they drove old dixie down

congregational church in st johnsbury vermont he said that when he resumed his religious studies he had refreshed his memory of the bible and had received excellent training as a youngster in that in church and through christian endeavor his son told me his father had read the bible completely through three times in his refreshment period his daughter told me her father read the bible every day dr bob told his son he had read for an hour every night drunk or sober for many years dr bob spoke of the immense amount of literature he read scads and scads of books were found in his home under his bed and in the homes of his kids after the books had allegedly have been thrown or given away and we now know the broad scope of the biblical christian devotional and other christian literature he read you can know it just by looking at the many remnant books we have found mentioned by family and friends or found in possession of his children there is no doubt that from early aa s beginnings dr bob set aside a quiet time three times each day for bible study prayer and reflection he read and circulated a large number of christian books on the bible jesus christ prayer quiet time the sermon on

could just be personality clash or the fact the medium or psychic concerned is full of their own self importance and feels superior to those they re seeing as if they re doing everyone a favour believe me there are plenty around like that no mediums should talk in strange voices talk of connecting with wondrous beings put on dramatics of any kind or frighten you by their behaviour 1 first

made a serious offer of several camels for his new wife on two occasions but still all cultures are equal right it was a cold still afternoon with a hard steely sky overhead when he slipped out of the warm parlour into the open air the country lay bare and entirely leafless around him and the thought that he had never seen so far and so intimately into the insides of the things as on that winter day when nature was dep in her annual slumber and seemed to have kicked the clothes off copses dells quarries and all hidden places which had been mysterious mines for exploration in leafy summer now exposed themselves and their secrets pathetically and seemed to ask him to overlook their shabby poverty for a while til they could riot in rich masquearade as before and trick and entice him with the old deceptions it was pitiful in a way and yet cheering even exhilarating he was glad that he liked the country undecorated hard and stripped of its finery he had got down to the bare bones of it and they were fine and strong and simple he did not want the warm clover and the play of seeding grasses the screens of quickset the billowy drapery of beech and elm seemed best away and with great cheerfulness of spirit he pushed on towards the wild wood which law before him low and threatening like a black reef in some still southern sea the last two days have been quite nice after last weeks

can make out of it is a claim that people become more extreme in their views whatever those views may be when they think about death that is a fairly humdrum proposal but does not correspond to how

written from a christian perspective probably for many of us we would do well to get into some kind of counseling and or therapy group for help in overcoming shame it is a really big mistake to try to deal with this one by ourselves many victims of abuse have so given themselves to helping others such as their children that they have neglected to seek help and therapy for themselves and that is not a good thing to continue to do additionally as of one week ago the u s had sold participating countries in the operation roughly 250 million in ammunition parts fuel technical assistance and other support according to the pentagon how you decide to balance out the flavours is down to experiment nevertheless for my taste the addition of fresh lemon juice a little salt and a good pinch of cayenne

extra sweetness on this occasion though i gave my last carrots and the tomato to the pigs for breakfast before filming doh have you started on it she asked i like blogging no i love blogging it s a

even a small toy of some sort as kids we were always excited to get our baskets mostly because we wanted to see what grandma had made us that year all the stuff inside was nice but the basket itself

detroit of delmon young apologizes after arrest bouillon cubes or broth chicken or beef everyone likes to be recognized and rewarded when they do something good and when our actions are rewarded we

law warranty or not that when something is purchased then it should last or serve it s purpose for a reasonable amount of time i also said that the life of a tv is longer than 18 months and that is

think it is i said you ve been looking for a book where you finish it with a smile on your face haven t you i know it well this is it as an instructor i have found that people love to see before and after or step by step progressions frequently i will have one page with the black white image and a colored version next to it if you don t have too many pieces in your portfolio then this is also a good way to fill up space i typically am not a mean person it s in my genes to be a people pleaser i blame my mother or i should probably thank her the title and authors are as follows and perhaps they can forgive me i don t know how to contact them anyway does anybody have their contact information here is the title credits and warning as well as all things you would expect to see carrots

can you have a case on while using the armband i really really want to get a cute case for my phone but i have to use a specific case with the armband i run with and the hard case that i had was incredibly difficult to get on and off i d like to be able to leave a decorative case on while i go running or i need to find a fun case that is easy to remove thoughts a poem could ravage your heart

you if you mess it up i m sure i ll add more i just like to have this in writing for the whole world to see to keep myself accountable what pleases me is that with the exception of a second amendment

market in the world of print provision faithfulness answered prayers alleluia ellen fullman is a highly original composer performer who plays on an instrument of her own invention the descriptively named long stringed instrument which consists of a set of fifty foot long wires that she bows and vibrates with her fingers the instrument produces unique droning layers of resonances rich and full and subtle on the four pieces that make up through glass panes fullman explores the contours of her instrument which she has been playing since 1981 in several different settings and with different combinations of collaborating musicians never gets out of me juxtaposes the deep resonances of the long stringed instrument with the comparatively traditional mournful cello tones of theresa wong and the effect is striking and melancholy wong s gorgeous minor key melodies seem like condensed versions of the stretched out tones that fullman pulls from her instrument as though the two musicians are exploring the same idea on entirely separate time scales on flowers fullman is joined by cellist henna chou and violinist travis weller and together the three musicians craft a much fuller and richer sound with crystalline structures assembled from their unison string tones this piece was recorded in an abandoned power plant and the recording emphasizes the hollow spaciousness of the surroundings as well as setting off the string drones from the delicate birdsong heard in the background the title track is composed for two performers with box bows hollow curved wooden blocks which create syncopated percussive patterns on the elongated strings of fullman s instrument the effect is almost folksy and guitar like recalling henry flynt s front porch minimalism with the rhythmic beats of the box bows contrasting against the underlying droney harmonics only on the final track event locations no 2 does fullman s instrument stand alone for a solo piece with the droning strings creating layers upon layers of beautiful emotionally charged overtones buy sew or iron your bottom and side hems leave the top un hemmed as this is where it will be attached to the mounting board in 2 peter 3 20 21 peter wrote about of the scriptures knowing this first that every prophecy of scripture comes not from one s own interpretation for prophecy never came by the will of man but holy men of god spoke by the holy spirit moving them by referring to scripture peter certainly had the paul s writings in mind peter had more than paul s writings in mind too look at the context of 2 peter 3 20 21 in 2 peter 1 16 19 peter referred to john james and himself witnessing the transfiguration and peter stated that we have the prophetic word that you do well to heed by we peter was referring to john and himself after james death in 2 peter 1 19 peter noted that you should follow the prophecy from john and himself and then peter refers to every prophecy of scripture in 2 peter 1 20 paul s writings were prophetic scripture and so were those of peter and john the new testament scriptures were being collected with paul s writings according to 2 peter 3 16 which according to 1 16 21 must include also the writings of peter and john there is a definite collection established and being built upon even at the time of the writing 2 peter being about 67 ad clearly the apostles did oversee the collection of the new testament scriptures the apostle john also has some words to add to these things in 1 john 1 1 4 john referred to all of the apostles writings john stated that we write john wrote we are writing these things referring to the apostles writings and this epistle of john again both john and peter affirmed their supervision of the collection of the new testament writings like

the group rented a house outside of london and spent days and nights playing music by the end of 1970 the brinsleys released a second album despite it all which indicated that they were evolving into a country rock outfit guitarist vocalist ian gomm joined the band at the end of the sessions for the record for much of 1971 brinsley schwarz rehearsed developing a blend of country folk r b and rock roll that was largely inspired by the byrds van morrison and the band as well as eggs over easy which the group met at the tally ho pub in kentish town silver pistol released early in 1972 demonstrated a new versatility but the group truly flexed its muscles in concert particularly during regular concerts at the tally ho soon they had built a small but loyal following and a number of likeminded bands began playing the same circuit eventually this grassroots phenomenon came to the attention of the u k press which dubbed the groups style as pub rock and proclaimed brinsley schwarz

support a proposition or lobby for a policy to allow those who are creative even if it does include someone he knows from enjoying financial benefits for a longer period we know there is a witch hunt

talent for showy ornamentation in other words knowing how to distract others to frivolous adorations nietzsche attributes this as a method by which women maintain their womanliness and charm society into not taking their persons seriously enough to analyze their deceptive nature for which their assumed secondary role serves as a perfect clout and the full extent of their cunning influence despite his chauvinism nietzsche staunchly believes that woman is the cleverer sex and thereby also the more evil one 14 this belief in the diabolical cleverness of women leads the philosopher to conclude that the overconfidence men have in their so called domestication of the female sex is nothing more than a façade promoted by women themselves it is fair to say after my initial disappointment and

ve read by hannah i should mention that it is now june 11 but it will most definitely not be my last i am officially a fan for life because a book with this level of awesome can not be a fluke her words her images her descriptions they all just consume you and immerse you into this world that is real and haunting and wonderful all at the same time when two people find safety in each other it is always wonderful and this is no exception uh uh uh no arguments we are just wandering or wondering are we if you are considering adopting a pet please come out and see what our local rescue

and it gave us our first view albeit foggy up the valley for the beginning we still had a track which we found pleasant because we didn t have to trip all over large cumbersome clumps of tussocks or snow grass under our feet the soft decomposing beech tree leaves cushioned our feet as we walked through what appeared to be an enchanted forest from inside it seemed like it stretched for miles but in reality it reached about a mile or so ahead of us a quarter mile behind us and maybe a third of a mile up river right of the valley now that the komen 3 day is over for the year i m experiencing

assured i am reading though i kept a journal all through high school and college but it wasn t until after i graduated from college that it actually occurred to me to try writing books i was reading world according to garp by john irving and with the arrogance only an early twenty something recent college grad can muster i said i could do that ah not sure which part i can give up i definitely feel i could give up my brother in any situation he finds a way to make it worse i try to avoid him he claims to want to see me i am beginning to believe he wants to see me so that he can make me miserable and my mum conspires to spring him on me but today i found myself giggling at random which has been very rare this winter and thought i d share one of the sources of the giggles clearly you

even the political question article vii section 1 of the constitution clearly provides there are many traditional hymns whose imagery is rooted in the concept of the holy war no matter that some of these are favorite songs or that this imagery is based upon scripture today for some thoughtful christians this imagery has become inappropriate many who have experienced the trauma of vietnam and of the religious wars in ireland and the near east find it difficult to sing about the church s mission in these terms sound the battle cry the son of god goes forth to war onward christian soldiers am i a soldier of the cross soldiers of christ arise stand up for jesus ye soldiers of the cross and other similar expressions are incompatible in today s world with the sharing of the good news about the love of god as seen in jesus christ the fact that many of us in the church do not connect such songs with the reality reported in the daily newspaper strongly points up the issue though we may simply enjoy the tunes and the vigorous cadence and ignore the words anywhoo no more downer news there is so much happening out in the garden already before i get to the picks though i ll give you some seed starting news the green peppers i started about a month ago are doing beautifully the little gardens that the kids started are doing very well too so we transplanted them into planters saturday

1 lots of water it might seem crazy to you know measure the water just to cook some green beans but this is one of the tricks to making fresh green bean casserole use two full quarts that s eight cups of water for every pound of green beans this gives the beans a lot of liquid to cook in and helps them cook fully and evenly two quarts of water almost fills my large dutch oven so to double or triple the recipe it s important to cook the beans in batches replenishing the water for each batch but how is this information collected today s daily q asks what exactly do lobbyists and clients have to

outcome that s easiest to do in scenes which consist primarily of action and dialogue with some internalization and description sprinkled in but narrative much maligned is often useful or even necessary despite the bad rap it gets from the oh so often repeated show don t tell rule we all throw around for kushiyaki there is waygu beef and chicken skewers each available in three different styles it might be best to order the harami trio and yakitori trio and get the chance to taste all three of each skewer style the harami trio come with wasabi garlic and miso while the yakitori comes with yuzu karai honey and teriyaki the beef and chicken were moist and tender and the different preps were good especially the elephant garlic chips and the karai honey their tempura dishes generally come with different sauces such as the calamari with korean chili and sesame cream reduction and the shrimp with a spicy cream sauce i would prefer to have my tempura without such a sauce but these dishes were still good and i liked the spiciness of the sauces alexis will be here in one week yay we are so excited as is our family and friends i can t wait to bring this little bundle of joy into

united states as well as other things but it was difficult to hear him at first when we heard of him and started to read an article about him and what he stands for we were kinda thinking he was a jerk before we got to listen and learn what he had to say at this moment i am watching the news and they are trying to portray the protest and the occupation as a lost cause and a cause without a

they want to rid the country of the capitalist corruption they all blame capitalism for this economic crisis i later walked to union square with maryanne and we were surround by a huge group that made us feel part of the moment question marks envelope our existence b 147 1 20 i love the first pick trent richardson will be a ferocious beast for cleveland then they went and ruined it by drafting a 28

why 25 get back the beatles love and hugs recently on a similar note i was reading one of my favorite blogs swissmiss by tina roth eisenberg tina wrote a wonderful post on march 3 about reaching a personal communication crisis in her post titled communication crisis tina is burdened with guilt because she is unable to keep up with all the blogging emailing texting tweeting facebooking and phone calling in her life and asks her readers to guide her in the proper communication etiquette she knows she has to simplify less channels more focus but she doesn t know where to begin i m talking about the dreaded skinny girl fat classification violent register on their site it s free complete the form about which documents you want compared pay the fee for the service around 50 and then send them a

wanted to see the movie was to watch daniel radcliffe twist and turn in horror unfortunally his character wasn t boring like that he was instead stupid enough to again and again face the vicious ghost head on siobhan herself might have finally snapped and wanted to further ensure andrew s downfall but similarly both olivia and catherine also had their motives this week for wanting siobhan dead as well with only five episodes left to go this is definitely one little mystery i can see being solved quicker than anything else multitablez one of the parameters in the poker rakeback is set volume and therefore the number of hands played if you multitablez multiplied the number of hands played per hour and increase so mathematically the amount of your winnings our first stop was a bit of lunch we stopped at a sushi restaurant right next to the seattle art museum and after lunch we went to the art museum we mainly went to see the gauguin show that is closing soon it was packed i typically stay away from these mega art shows since it so difficult to actually see the art and everyone walks around like zombies with those little phone tour gadgets the show was interesting regardless of the crowd gauguin seemed to be such an inconsistent artist some of his paintings are full of such lovely detail while others just really floundered actually most of them floundered that being said the handful of paintings which i enjoyed were absolute perfection and as this chart from mike s paper illustrates american politicians have dug a huge hole relying on the empty promises of washington politicians will be far more risky than personal retirement accounts summary all of the peoples of the earth lived in the same place and spoke the same language the decided using the technology of

pay the man session that ended up not getting released i think steve immerwahr who went on to form codeine had some connection with him initially we were supposed to record umber in january 1989 with albini but orestes had a death in the family and we had to cancel at the last minute albini ended up giving that studio time to slint and that s when they recorded the session that became the 10 on

a little late with posting my card the sandown show was very busy yesterday and i was just a bit tired last night fell asleep watching big brother which isn t like me lol it was sooo good to see so many of you bloggers and attendees of the little claire days i so lovely catching up with everyone awesome as f k is what a live album should be fun fresh and fantastic as the title even alludes to its f king awesome and the album immediately drops you into that concert environment the last two times i saw green day was during the first leg of the 21st century breakdown tour with their final show at the forum and during new years at l a live near the nokia theatre in los angeles both times they sounded fantastic but the new years gig was even more amazing at that show they primarily played their old stuff from kerplunk insomniac 39 smooth and a handful of current songs from american idiot and 21st century breakdown maybe three or so during a 90 minute set the raw energy they infused the audience with at each show created two great memories for this green day fan whoever controls the energy and food also controls the political i confess i have a tender spot in my heart for a pathetic character when we hear the word pathetic these days it s usually derogatory as in oh that was pathetic or what a pathetic attempt that was but that s not a definition that fits with the original concept behind so needless to say i had to get over freddy before i could really start delving into the horror genre i wasn t allowed to see the exorcist just yet though my dad was ready to allow me priviledge to rent it if i wanted to because at 15 i was mature enough this coming from the guy that sat me down to watch child s play 3 to prove that chucky was fake i was 9 none of my dolls stayed in my room after that i want to move back to london only to discover that all i can afford is a cupboard in a garden shed now woodlice i count as among the best of my friends but i am allergic to rudimentary pots aesthetically they cause me hives so money is necessary i have been looking forward to this day for nearly 9 months it s here my stuff is laid out i am hydrating and getting into bed early i m preparing for pain but i hope i am pleasantly surprised and i think i will be that i ll have a great day it will be wonderful to see people i know along the way do join in the

romney by wh propagandist hilary rosen is par for the femisogynist course starting back in oh who the knows but it was decades ago feminists started attacking traditional gender roles demanding that women be free to well to fit their mold as pseudo men being a stay at home mom was right up there with being a bitter clinger anyone not adhering to this new policy of women have to be men to succeed was to be ridiculed and shunned and my new life is now today hidden with christ in god tuesday april 25 1967 what mattered more to the key voters of bradford and didn t even appear on the radar

down pour earrings i checked the notes she had come in with an msq score of something like 3 out of 10 which meant she was quite disorientated i ran the questions again i asked her who the prime minister was and she said mr fisher no mr hughes i asked her the year and she said 1915 on the msq that s a simple 0 out of 2 but the answers were consistent i asked her how old she was she said she thought she was 12 she was certain she was not more than 14 but said that if it was 1915 she was 12 0 from 3 but had it been 1915 3 from 3 okay so this argument may not be convincing but you can t say

a tamale but here when i reached into the tortilla holder i grabbed the flour tortilla on top halfway into my soft taco sam noticed i was eating one of his corn tortillas thin and mashed very fine i didn t taste the difference the stout margarita might have had something to do with it tao comes over to me and we look at them bathed in the sunshine some mouse birds nearby in the loquat tree the chickens foraging passionately around us he looks at me and asks me if i want to try it why not we prepare it way too much of it a long process we drink it way too much of it and it tastes bad in addition to being slimy and gelatinous an instant gagging process but i want a break from mind i want to return to the natural state nothing else calls me deeper the start point was getting to a seminar workshop that was relevant to product suppliers having attended several that were certainly interesting but not really relevant and not with anyone there that could outline what we needed to do the lights came on when i attended a howitt consulting bim workshop designed for product suppliers with great support from metz architects they run these on a regular basis next one is may 31st http www howittconsulting co uk click on specialist seminars how to sit my recovery was pretty intense and i guess i never really thought about that part of the process i was too worried about the whole labor part that i completely neglected worrying about the recovery guess it worked out in my favor because it s not like i needed anything else to stress over i will say my whole body was sore from pushing for about a week my lower region was very tender for about the first week after and that there s a lot of blood basically everything this post mentions is the perfect explanation it s so real and true to life eventually i was able to get around pretty easily and was back to normal pretty quickly as of two weeks postpartum i have lost about 25 pounds of about 30 that i gained i m pretty pleased with that number so did his father before him until his gruesome murder by a ghost he sought to kill now armed with his father s mysterious and deadly athame cas travels the country

filled with the sounds of those things that go bump in the night i was very taken with the woman before me it has its weaknesses and i m not going to ignore them but i loved the premise and frankly expected to be disappointed by her next novel which i imagined would fall back on a more traditional style i thought this approach would work for one novel but that would be it i m pleased to say i ve been proved wrong the question is has she fallen foul to the law of diminishing returns you know what i m on about you re hungry and someone hands you a ham and mustard sandwich and it s the very best ham and mustard sandwich that you have ever had in your puff and it s so good that you want to eat it all over again whereupon your kindly host hands you another identical sarnie but it never is the same is it whereas the first one was great this second one is only very good at best i participated in bountiful baskets for the first time a couple of weeks ago one of things i got was apples i love to eat apples but unfortunately these weren t the best eating apples they were a little sour and didn t have much flavor the most requested make up look and frequently asked question is how do you do a smokey eye our voices won t change and that s a large part of why we decided to merge three distinct povs sharing a common vibe of advertising design and all things net in other words a little something for everybody good morning everyone today i d like to share a project with you that i put together yesterday one of my blogging buddies ana at scrappy pink corner made these gorgeous bird houses which inspired me to create one as well i was working with a team around a customer service project yesterday when one of them said rather petulantly but we did this three years ago why hasn t it worked well the only answer to this was that perhaps it did work but it worked three years ago rather like keeping herman on the road you don t just fix him once and he goes forever but rather he runs until the next thing starts squeaking or falls off until the next intervention is required that organisation probably did solve it s customer service challenge three years ago but the world has changed the challenge they face is how to learn from their heritage the tribal knowledge that sits within the organisation but how also to update and retell that story in a way that s relevant today

workers who are not citizens but whose children are because they were born in the country and have their own social security numbers they say such children should reap the benefit of the tax credit just like other children in comparable economic circumstances it will be wasted breath because most people reasonably enough want to see that there s a life worth living on the other side of the changes your activist movement wants to make and the best way to give them a glimpse of that life is to enact it yourself it will also be wasted breath because most people have a tolerably good nose for hypocrisy and are highly familiar with the kind of demagogy that calls on everybody else to make sacrifices and get by with less so the demagogue doesn t have to do so talk to americans who didn t support either the climate change movement or its corporate opposition and you ll find that for a good many of them it was when word of al gore s air conditioned mansion and frequent flyer miles got

myself relax due to the moneylender s trap you borrow money at a very high interest rate and are not able to pay back even the interest as your crop is poor because of the drought the farmers are committing suicides selling their land cattle and even their wives one problem is that the soil here retains very little water unlike the black soil in other regions of madhya pradesh if it does not rain at the right time with the right consistency the drought related distress affects the next year s rabi crop as well at a certain point you have to recognize that your interests will be trampled on if your relationship is about how your relationship doesn t work and you see no improvement then your healthiest move may be to end it you are entitled to more and if the passive aggressive in your life cannot or will not give it seek your happiness elsewhere again it means sizing up the situation realistically knowing what he does and does not give to the relationship assessing the real value of his promises to change well i decided yesterday since there was not going to be any baseball on i d stop at the local card shop and see if i could add anything interesting to the 2011 baseball card

at this point i am so close to having this baby and so far away from remembering what normal feels like so i am missing it all from having my normal body to eating certain foods to less bathroom breaks and eager to get back into my exercise routine i would like to think that if and when i do find someone silly enough to marry me i d be prepared to do it in a uniform with a boring ass three

course you don t want having kids to make you unhappy but kids are not meant to fulfill their parents this article seemed to be getting at this when it talked about how much pressure american parents put on themselves to raise perfect kids rather than shooting for good kids it would be exhausting to try and sculpt a kid into a perfect all star straight a ivy league doctor or whatever especially since they actually have a say in the matter and will ultimately do what they want all parents can do is try and give them stability love and guidance not turn them into superheros i can understand wanting the best for your kids and i tend to think that luthien is the smartest little baby that has ever existed but i try to remember that she isn t my little project but rather a little human that

sentiments of these things happen for a reason or this is god nature s way of weeding out the sick and the unhealthy ones or it s all for the best or you can always have more kids it cuts mothers of the unborn to the core think of how cruel it would be to say any of those things to the mother of a 6 year old who had died of leukemia you wouldn t because that would be horrid i can tell you that the mother of an unborn child lost at any stage in pregnancy feels just as much that she is a mother and that was her child as the mother of a child of any age so telling her that her baby was just a malformed sick affront to evolution that is better off dead is not helpful comforting or kind don t say it or anything that makes it seem like this was supposed to happen because even though we know it s true and that if something was terribly wrong it probably is better that the baby died early the idea that there was something so wrong with our child that it couldn t even live is frightening upsetting and awful and none of it takes away the fact that we lost a child we didn t lose a fetus we lost our baby it died it will never be in our belly or arms again we won t get to meet it or see it or hold it and play with it we can t watch it grow up it s gone and dead which is tragic and intensely painful the period of times for the internship hours and total duration are flexible we are

primarily these colours although you can use small amounts of other colors neutrals etc interestingly in any military training all over the world the soldiers are asked to see the enemies as dangerous objects which need to be eliminated the psychology behind indoctrination of such an idea is that when they think the enemy is a human being the soldiers are unable to raise their arms there are many

time i posted i seemed to have stepped on some toes that are special toes in my life the post was a good one was actually a great one and it was meant to celebrate some of the awesome young adult unschoolers in my life it came across to a few people as being critical of more traditional paths of learning and parenting and of some specific people that i care about a lot that was not my intention at all however i deleted it and have written and deleted a whole bunch of other posts in my head since then it s been over two months since i ve posted here although i have opened up my blog to write dozens of times i recently realized that all the unwritten words are completely clogging up my brain because i don t have enough memory or the right editing tools to keep it all straight up

finding themselves in a market not a temple where merchants and money changers were able to make a profit from their need to present perfect animals for sacrifice and to use the correct coinage it s understandable that those who benefited from the arrangement in the temple were also angry and wanted to know what right jesus had to drive everyone out love cannot be forced ordered or made obligatory it is necessarily free if god liberates it is because he expects and hopes that we will come to know him and love him he cannot lead us to do so by terrorizing us 55 played chicken it seems

with much grinding of teeth we began looking at mobile homes on acreage my husband asked me can interior decorators really live in mobile homes i can t deny this training has been exteremely useful in many ways but it also leads me to quickly form opinions and draw conclusions on the basis of what i already know or i might say on just what i know so far when this becomes a problem is in the context of studying working or just being in another culture i don t always notice the most relevant information or sometimes worse i do notice it but misinterpret it with 3 890 female officers guarding some

distraction no forceful matter can ever erase he actually had his best suit on he had a clipboard and a pen on his hand and it made him seem like he was actually noting everything down in all honesty the sight of him would make any older brother proud one night this week my honey greeted me at the door with a long island iced tea that was awesome remember when that loud unruly kid was a punk remember when that quiet girl doing art in the back of the room was weird remember when the kids who were leaders were predictable and understandable what a cool world that we live in that none of that is true anymore it is a true story the monster said many things that are true feel like a cheat oh the inconvenience of having to call the cops the last time craig mummey and i worked together was four years ago at silver spring stage on the cripple of inishmaan by martin mcdonagh we kept meaning to do a project together again after cripple was a success but it never quite worked out and now here we are and i for one am thrilled to be working with one of my favorite directors again and one thing to note for the people who leave the grass is rarely greener i will say that the three raiders who left dreamstate for greener pastures did not find them and the 14 who left conquest probably won t either all they will find is that matticus dealt with a lot of headaches they didn t even know existed probably the only case where you will be happier is if you make a radical change in your raiding focus i e go from casual to hardcore or hardcore to casual i actually think those words are hopelessly inadequate to define raiding teams these days but they will do rfa wouldn t be useful for these players either because if you want to make that change in focus you are never going to be

the department is proposing to apply new punitive penalty rules to transfers of assets which have occurred since february 8 2006 as of the date of the implementation of the new rules transfers of assets for less than fair market value meaning gifts will result in the applicant being ineligible for medicaid coverage for a certain time period this time period does not begin until the month the person is eligible for medicaid meaning in need of long term care services and having an approved medicaid application but for the imposed penalty period the penalty period is calculated by dividing the total uncompensated value of assets transferred by the average monthly cost of long term care services at the private rate in the community in which the person s nursing home is located at the time of application the result is the transfer penalty period of ineligibility in number of months days and portion of a day for example if a person makes gifts to grandchildren of a total of 65 000 in june of 2006 and then applies for medicaid on or before may of 2011 assuming an average private rate of 4000 they will be deemed to be ineligible for medicaid for a period of approximately 16 months and 7 5 days beginning with the month that their medicaid application for nursing home care is approved while i managed to show a bit of restraint stéphane requested four items and charmed the young pastry chefs at the vatel international hospitality school by telling them that we should have started with dessert then when i worked in a private reading clinic for 8 years i encountered many many more children who were diagnosed with adhd some on medication some not and as i worked with these kids i could not really see any big problem other than that they were active curious kids who simply required more energy to work with than others this was not a problem at all for me because they were just so much like my own son well after a crazy and tiring week we had a very lazy weekend

put it out of my head and returned home to carry on as normal brent was now home from work and we were just talking about random things and of course i mentioned we had been to see the house told him it was really run down but had great potential totally to my surprise he commented that it would be a great house to sink your teeth into that was all it took and it rolled forward at lightening speed

what are you doing thursday evening i had a function to cater at the club if you actually think about it trying to figure out just what exactly spring break is for can be a little daunting there are usually two trains of thought when it boils down to the bare bones those are spring break is for relaxation and to let it all hang loose or spring break is a time to get all your loose ends in order and prepping for the run to the summer seeing as though this is my first spring break my parents wanted me to return home the week i am off mainly because they didn t want to spend on a week vacation to jamaica that they weren t apart of and they missed me still trying to get out of the few remaining vice grips my mom has on me since i am home they have the notion of putting me to work and cleaning up around the house all week long is it wrong that i see spring break as a relaxing time in between two college quarters this is where people begin the divide on what spring break stands for 7 stuff the envelopes done while watching softball chatting about other wedding details by far the quickest part of the process however i would suggest to anybody using these doilies fold the sides on

resolute and courageous which will piss lefties off the miner s strike which is along with unemployment represents the sum total of her time in office according the the labour view of history is glossed over as were the preparations stockpiling coal undersea cables to france etc which were not mentioned the falklands conflict gets a more thorough treatment her dismissal of the haig shuttle was believable the controversy over the sinking of the general belgrano was avoided by the rare cinematographic technique of being factually correct i made a piece of word art in the style of the old new york subway signage and so i ve turned to my work revamping my coaching programs reflecting on my own process that got me to this point tinkering with ideas to spread this indescribable peace one of the strongest points brought up by the comments on bob miller s piece for publishingperspectives com is the analogy that publishers and authors do not approach the imminent launch of a book in the way a new film might be promoted certainly there is a strong argument that a film has a greater wow factor due to its inherent visual medium but then that is the imagined vision as like all expectations and christmas presents we will only have been indulged in the snippets and teases of what is beneath the wrapping the reading public is on a par with the cinematic going public and given so many crossovers it is hard to see why publishers do not explore this kind of pre publication promotion a lot more when a forthcoming film is promoted we are indulged in directors producers screen writers as well as actors doing their all in partnership for the good of the product how might this work with a book can we see the day when in partnership author publisher book designer even the editor and literary agent get to herald their stamp on the book project what is so alien about this to us ressentiment is not to be considered interchangeable with the normal english word resentment or even the french ressentiment while the normal words both speak to a feeling of frustration directed at a perceived source neither speaks to the special relationship between a sense of inferiority and the creation of morality now were going to do the little casings for the ribbon cut out two pieces of muslin 5 x1 do a zigzag stitch around all 4 sides on both pieces again keep the zigzag

hello hello hope you all had a wonderful holiday ours was nice and there was a blizzard here monday in case you hadn t heard we had just under two feet of snow and for reasons yet to be determined it was chaos and still challenging for many and i have been loving it we had a lot of fun in school today the teaching your children joy activity today introduced beck to charting i was a little nervous that he wouldn t understand the concept but he caught on quick and even put his own spin on it bottom right wedding band in my youth i had an experience that has become a hallowed memory yes my meeting and conversation with him was a touchstone to other writers i admired but it was the man william alfred himself with his gentle unassuming manner his love of humanity and his generosity of spirit who has loomed large in my memory for i had the privilege that day of being in the presence of a remarkable human being he was a devout catholic who lived his faith he gave to the poor and he opened his home and heart to students i would meet alfred one last time outside st paul it was summer and he was wearing a seersucker suit and a straw hat that looked as if it had been run over by a truck twice he smiled shook my hand and asked whether i was well i answered this is called passage to it s an addictive smell very spicy and womanly i usually wear it at night and i guess i wear it pretty often because it s totally empty there s a lot of difference daniel said he was going to continue but instead he just sighed and sat down himself he leaned back in his chair before sitting

my shop had done a safety for his son had paid my brother in law 2500 and the car had died less than one week after he bought it he explained it had come back my brother in law had taken forever to do the repairs wasn t returning phone calls etc but that his son got the car back and then it totally died a second time and now it was the engine was completely seized so just to remind you if you spend

reality much it looks more gray than blue and you can tell that the colors are wrong because they obviously used the same mannequin for the sax version and for the brown version but the mannequin with the sax version is kind of a way darker reddish gray than all of the other ones it seems like the colors haven t been adjusted properly for this one only and i wonder if it has to do with the fact that they are all sold out right now except for the sax and red ones the truth is that unless you are some really cool exception your release day is pretty darned quiet most launch parties and tours happen after the fact and most people won t read your book until after it s out so while there may be a little bit of hype on that huge release day special thanks to anyone who helps spread news about the book today i ve found that any time a book of mine is officially out there it always feels a bit anticlimactic this is silly since i don t expect much anyway but i think it feels that way because it is a huge freaking deal in my head so big that fireworks should be going off a novel is a deeply personal blood sweat and tears project it should feel like a huge deal it is a huge deal according

the one knock on this juventus team was the claim that they did not possess a match winner such as zlatan ibrahimovic who could beat teams on his own even when the rest were performing poorly time and again the swede has dug milan out of a hole scoring more league goals 28 than he has ever before in a single season and yet this is the first season in which ibrahimovic has failed to finish top of his domestic league since 2003 one of my first posts talked about figuring out how to live in this new reality waiting for a reality that i want doesn t seem to be working i need to learn to make the most of the reality while it is the reality waiting is not going to make it better making it better while i m waiting is in my control and worthy of my energy i put that in bold to remind myself and hopefully find a way to put it into action of course i also understand that in order to make the best of the moment i must understand and accept the moment feeling the flow right now i am sitting in

an almost middle aged woman of color who looks triumphant and borderline weepy as she graduates all while talking about making life better for her children they know exactly who is unemployed right now and they have geared these endless commercials for the tech college racket specifically to them the tip of the iceberg is that the note was not delivered to the investors the gravitas of the

social worker a single mom with two kids of her own grilled me mercilessly for almost two hours where i had grown up what was my nuclear family like had i ever been married had my parents ever hit me was i in a serious relationship how did i feel about corporal punishment could i support the boys financially what would i do if the boys got sick and had to stay home from school where would the boys sleep were my dogs friendly had they ever bitten anyone was i really serious about taking the boys permanently did i understand the commitment involved many of the questions had to do with race how was i a single white woman prepared to raise two african american boys by the time the social worker left i was exhausted but aside from needing to drain the hot tub in the backyard foster homes are not allowed to have trampolines or hot tubs and put up a hand rail on the stairs to the unfinished basement i had been approved but i bet you still have a bit of belly fat i remember just being like ya ned that sounds cool but i didn t really dig it as much as i liked my idea at the time thinking about it now though my idea was awful and title fight definitely is better than what i thought was a good idea last friday andrew and i had dinner with a few people at a friend s house i can t remember when i think after our first loss i found out that our friend nicole had a 6 week loss on either side of that loss she has two beautiful girls ages 6 and 1 and a half other than that loss nicole has lost a lot of people in her life it s probably hard for people to understand the immensity of her losses when most people have only lost a couple people in their lives by their mid 20 s i don t mean to diminish anyone s loss losing even one person in your life is difficult but i think that when several people in your life die it definitely takes its toll on you it s also different when it s your grandparents who lived long and fulfilling lives compared to your sister who left behind her two kids i don t think she gets to really talk about it well once in awhile you just need a pity party and isn t alcohol always the best catalyst for it an inspector calls 1954 hollywood movie watch

be closer to him than drona the word deliberate in the above definition is the only word that throws a spanner in the works all the other terms tally 100 percent with what is happening in south africa at this very moment the word deliberate however has bearing on the conscious intent of the perpetrators it thus creates a loophole which the criminals and the government can rely on to effectively shift the spotlight away from genocide and to thus blame the killings on other factors such as crime poverty etc how many times has malema for example said that chanting the words kill the boer has caused no harm how many times have we heard the savage killers the few that get arrested say in court we never acted deliberately telephones were treated differently then in our home the telephone was

college a number that has doubled since 1980 as we work to encourage more indigenous peoples to attend college we also have to be mindful of tuition costs and the costs it takes to offer a quality education these questions certainly inform the fact that we are in the beginning stages of what is arguably a massive transformation in the higher education experience due to online technologies for example colleges are rethinking their academic infrastructures in order to best serve the upcoming student bodies stanford university has begun to offer free classes open courseware is maintained by several universities and the kuhn academy is gaining in popularity perhaps these and other activities will point the way to an educational experience that keeps its relevancy to and affordability for

summer card front swap on my favorite mb i love how they turned out if i remember correctly i used more mustard pumpkin pie and cajun craze to create the sky and sea and early espresso to create the mountains i added some details in the pcean with my white signo pen then finished the fronts off by adding them to basic black cardstock and added the little tabs which are made with my window label punch and attached with brads the sentiment is punched out also with the word window and matted onto the modern label punch i stamped the sanded background stamped onto the now retired dusty durango

the layout and appearance however are very distracting for me i have no sense of what this blog focuses on because i am still trying to figure out what all the various widgets are the features distract me from the message in this case i can read this blog through a reader rather than going to the blog itself but then i miss out on things like photos blurbs graphics colors etc that are visually appealing again i like just enough but not too much call me goldilocks i can t say that third i despise the institution of segregation and i would like to point out that the first segregation laws in the south were instituted by yankee occupiers during the reconstruction period after the confederacy was conquered segregation began in the north you see after slavery was eradicated there this was the way northerners dealt with keeping the races apart once slaves were free institutionalised segregation in a slave economy is nearly impossible for slaves had to work in fields alongside many of their masters cook in the kitchens with their master s wives saw in the mills with their overseers and shop in the marketplaces to carry the goods you just can t have real segregation in a slave economy however once the slave economy is eradicated then you can effectively enforce segregation laws such was the case in the northern states once they eliminated slavery there before the civil war then after the southern states were conquered southern men were no longer allowed to hold political office see the fourteenth amendment to the u s constitution for details so northern opportunists carpetbaggers came down south to run for elected office these yankee carpetbaggers were the men who set up the south s segregation system after slavery was eradicated by the thirteenth amendment to the u s constitution segregation was foreign to the south prior to the civil war yes a southern class system existed but it was not segregated in the way we understand segregation today modern segregation is a northern invention exported to the southern states as a consequence of losing the civil war after a century of segregation in the southern states many white southerners defended it to their shame but many white southerners also opposed it we must always keep that in mind the dixie flag the christian cross of st andrew was abused by many racists during that time but then so was the american flag right along side it such abuse remains to this day to associate the dixie flag with segregation and racism exclusively is intellectually dishonest for the american flag

the realm of faith religion god satan the soul and there are many scenes and individual shots that play into this of which the one that has always impressed me the most is the cringe inducing examination scene where poor little regan macneil linda blair is being poked and prodded in the most squirmy painful looking ways in the hopes of finding an explanation for her strange affliction the subtext of course is that all of this modern medical suffering she undergoes is completely pointless no doctor can diagnose what regan suffers from the way this is starting to happen is through independent films why april is the cruellest month well one of the first things i remember thinking that i continued thinking throughout the entire game was wow that is a lot of red we were sporting our purple pride for sure but they had almost double the amount of fans in the stands now don t let the lopsided numbers fool you this comparison might help put things in prospective but i say the heart advises these goals and lays the foundation for the reader s emotional attachment in fact the heart is the only reason to care whether the character achieves any of their goals heart gives humanity to the book and humanity not the cleverness of a hook endears the reader to the story it gives readers emotional entrance not just mental entanglement a week later she was flown back to the u

this for the past 4 months it s one of the big reasons i implemented my points system to get me back on track when i am feeling hungry i want sugary or starchy snacks up until last week i had been reaching for less nutritious snacks even if i had a cheese stick or yogurt packed and in my lunch bag i would walk into rob s office and reach into her goodie basket for something sweet chocolate was always the first choice but even things like laffy taffy or nerds candy would do in a pinch which i dont like in the last few months the rents have dived because several occupants have returned home

students in november 2011 was not only directed against police brutality but also against the uc davis administration s repression of political activism on our campus we view the use of retroactive legal actions against demonstrating students as an effort to carry out such repression of political activity while attempting to evade the public scrutiny to which the administration s repressive measures have been subjected moreover in this case these retroactive legal actions clearly target a small sub group of the demonstrators involved in blockading the bank suggesting that specific demonstrators are being targeted for selective prosecution so as to single out and intimidate the most active student protesters we rented a house and moved in at the beginning of october yes it s only been a month but it feels like it s been forever it feels like home already in fact the day we signed the lease it felt like home to me the recipe relies on using store bought frozen bread dough

beads of sweat was on this guy s brow none because i already told you he s like hannibal lecter in fact if anyone who knows him happens to read this you are no longer permitted to address him by his christian name rather you shall only refer to him as dr hannibal lecter if you are like me and have been swooned by the warm seductive flavor of real vanilla beans then this will change your life well

correcting wayne and philippa throughout the show and being a right snobby pain in the bottom i quite liked this version of angus but finally philippa who played chloemiddia snapped and more drama ensued to hilarious climax original air date apr 18 2012 i give a time one particular morning when our bathroom was still located in the great outdoors she woke up and had to go out to the greenhouse she realized as she got up that she had to go pretty bad and wasn t sure if she was going to make it she had a pretty steep flight of stairs to go down and realized when she got to the bottom that there was no way she was going to make it without having an accident so she made an executive decision to just step off to the side of the steps and go she hit a patch of ice which caused her to go down along with her pants even now 25 years later i still laugh at the picture this paints in my mind i envision bambi when he first stepped on ice the next emerald pointe board of directors meetings will be on wednesday may 16th at 6 00 pm and wednesday may 30th time tbd in the clubhouse you are invited to attend if you wish attendees are allowed to observe but not to participate in the meeting the problem with christian music is that a person listening to it can quickly develop the idea that what christianity is about is having happy feelings because people feel happy when listening to music i ve noticed that a lot of christians leave the faith because they have this idealized notion that the world should be a happy place where no one ever feels bad then they find verses in the bible that are exclusive and judgmental and they leave the faith because christianity is too mean when i say unschooling should be available to everyone i think it s important to note the should i also say that i believe every child is capable of being and deserves to be in control of their own education what i ve never said is that unschooling is currently available for every individual because it s not but instead of saying as many seem to that because it s currently not available for every individual unschooling and freeschooling isn t the answer not sure how that logic works i simply see there being lots of work that needs to be done to make freedom based education available for all i feel like that s what i m working towards both with local projects i m involving myself in and i should point out that the local people working for educational freedom are very conscious of social factors and very involved in social justice work and the advocacy for unschooling that i do i see myself as part of a movement towards a far more egalitarian future and since i think education is a very important part of that movement and something i m passionate about that s what i m focusing on right now note that i say part of a movement towards an egalitarian future because i don t talk much about my other social political views on this blog perhaps it s easy for people to forget about them and maybe think that when i talk about universal unschooling i m envisioning this exact same way of living only with unschooling instead of school that could not be further from the truth i m talking about entire social transformation radical decentralization autonomous communities etc and within that framework i see unschooling as naturally becoming the default and a good way of moving towards a different way of living is building creating as many positive alternatives to the current way of doing things as we can i believe showing in as many ways as we can that other realities are possible and attainable i see unschooling and freeschooling as part of this what influences are the most important for that album there is a gold light in certain old paintings yes she baby is due

been offline for a bit celebrating my 26th birthday i m on the back end of my twenties now at least i m not a vegan or i d look like i was on the back end of my forties the rajya sabha s discussion on the copyright amendment bill 2010 was interrupted as soon as it began instead the brief discussion pivoted around the possible conflict of interest of the concerned minister of human resource development mr kapil sibal pictured here this question was raised because mr sibal s son amit sibal represents the music company t series super cassettes industries limited which is a major stakeholder in the copyright industry in india see for example here and i really liked this one we have no government armed with the power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and true religion our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other john adams we re not much fond of rats either but that s tempered by a recent rereading of charlotte s web and the snarly wonderfulness of templeton ellington continued on his own course through these tectonic shifts in the music business he did not wholly resist trends while trying to turn out major works the kay davis vocal feature transblucency was an attempt to cater to the singer centric music world he still performed major extended compositions such as harlem 1950 whose score he presented to music loving president harry truman but these works were rapidly becoming reflections of his greatness in the 1930s and 1940s and not ground breaking works that rattled the music world back into the big band camp i myself can look at almost any hemline silhouette beadwork or heel architecture and tell you very precisely who designed it first what french painter they stole it from how many designers reinvented it after them and what cultural and musical movement parented the birth death and resurrection of that particular trend being able to carry a story and hold an audience for a long amount of time is a skill but long winded doesn t always mean good nowadays i m discovering that there is much more merit in being able to

2 paleo meals per day i m pleased to say that it lived up to my vague but positive memory of renting it back in 90 although clearly a very low budget film it has a smart and genuinely witty screenplay that keeps you guessing almost until the end strong b movie performances from forster robert davi licence to kill and leading actress hilary shepard a lovely woman who really should have had a bigger screen career and amazing stunt work of the kind you rarely see today even in big budget studio flicks i guess that s my story for now i seriously think if i hear another person tell me it can t

therefore slowed down economic growth errr am i wrong in remembering that the full repeal of glass steagall occurred in 1999 at the height of one of the biggest economic expansions in history so how exactly did it slow down economic growth the commenter then went on to point out that no canadian banks failed due to smart regulations which while in opposition the current conservative government fought against and kind of proves my point for me doesn t it we missed the brunt of the financial shitstorm because of government regulation and oversight not because a lack of it or am i missing something oh hi i didn t see you there this is definitely improvised that is both a true statement and the title of this site this podcast masquerades as an improvised radio show i am the disembodied

honest every few weeks is i will have some friends over we will talk about stuff and then we will pull some newspaper clippings out of a ziploc bag and do scenes based on those newspaper clippings
