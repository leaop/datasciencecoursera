unless oil rebounds immediately to a profitability point of 75 a barrel the industry will suffer exploration will cease and supplies will be thin once demand picks up i m all for companies making money but since september of 2007 crude prices have averaged just about 106 a barrel since oil began to sag on the world markets in october the running average since september 2007 is still 99 a barrel and even if prices were to continue at a level of 45 a barrel for the next 12 months the average would still be at the magic price of 75 a barrel this happens to be a down cycle for oil but it s hardly the calamity that oil companies would have us believe i see no legitimate business reason why there should be any concern until the average price dips below 75 a barrel by my calculations that will be at least a year away under the worst of circumstances until then i would hope that oil companies will do what all companies should do dip into profits earned during the good times and continue to do business the price will rebound in time but i doubt that americans will be too happy if exploration and investment cease while oil companies sit on those huge profits thereby causing
