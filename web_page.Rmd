## Welcome

This presentation was created as part of a course assignment. It uses **Plotly** to display interactive data visualizations in a web presentation format using **R Markdown**.

## The Dataset

We’ll use the classic `mtcars` dataset that contains fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
data <- mtcars %>% tibble::rownames_to_column("model")

plot_ly(data = data, 
        x = ~wt, 
        y = ~mpg, 
        type = 'scatter', 
        mode = 'markers',
        text = ~model,
        marker = list(size = 10, color = 'blue')) %>%
  layout(title = "Fuel Efficiency vs Car Weight",
         xaxis = list(title = "Weight (wt)"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)"))
```
